  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"commodity\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences using the word \"commodity\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. A commodity is a raw material or a product that's interchangeable in its type, like oil or wheat. So, the sentences should reflect that.\n\nThe user specified maximum two sentences. Let me start with the first one. Maybe something about agricultural products. Like, \"Farmers sell their commodity crops at the market.\" That's straightforward. \n\nFor the second sentence, maybe something more specific. Like, \"The company's stock rose as the commodity prices increased.\" That shows how commodity prices affect the stock market. \n\nWait, I should check if \"commodity\" is used as a noun here. Yes, in the first sentence, it's clear. The second sentence uses it as a noun in the context of prices. That should work. Let me make sure the sentences are correct and not too complex. Yeah, that's it. No need for explanations, just the sentences.\n...done thinking.\n\nfarmers sell their commodity crops at the market; the company's stock rose as the commodity prices increased"
