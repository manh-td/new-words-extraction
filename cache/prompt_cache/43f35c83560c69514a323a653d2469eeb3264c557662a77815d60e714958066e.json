  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"commodity\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences using the word \"commodity\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. A commodity is a raw material or a product that's interchangeable, like oil or wheat. So, the sentences should reflect that.\n\nThe user specified maximum two sentences. Let me start with the first one. Maybe something like \"Coffee is a commodity that is traded globally.\" That shows it's a raw material that's traded. Then the second sentence could be \"The company's profits depend on the value of their commodity goods.\" That uses it in a business context, which is common. I need to check if these examples are accurate and natural. Also, ensure the format is correct, no JSON or explanation. Just the sentences separated by semicolons. Alright, that should work.\n...done thinking.\n\ncoffee is a commodity that is traded globally; the company's profits depend on the value of their commodity goods"
