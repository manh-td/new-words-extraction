  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"niche\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"niche\" as a verb. Let me start by recalling what I know about the verb form of \"niche.\"\n\nFirst, the noun \"niche\" means a small cavity or a place where something is placed. As a verb, it can mean to create a cavity or to place something in a small cavity. So, synonyms for the verb would be words that mean to create or to place in a niche.\n\nI remember that \"carve\" is a good synonym for \"niche\" as a verb. Carving involves creating a cavity, which matches the meaning. Another possible word is \"insert,\" but that's more about putting something in, which is similar but not exactly the same. \"Insert\" is more about placing, while \"carve\" is about creating. \n\nWait, are there other synonyms? Maybe \"form\" or \"make\"? But \"form\" is more general. \"Make\" is too vague. So the best ones are \"carve\" and \"insert.\" But I need to check if \"insert\" is considered a synonym here. The original meaning of \"niche\" as a verb is to create a cavity, so \"insert\" might be more about placing, which is slightly different. \n\nSo the most accurate synonyms would be \"carve\" and \"insert.\" But I should verify if \"insert\" is commonly used in this context. Maybe \"carve\" is the primary synonym, and \"insert\" is a less common one. However, the user asked for maximum two synonyms, so both are acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, \"embed\" could be another option, but that's more about putting something into a place, which is similar to \"insert.\" But \"embed\" is more about securing rather than creating a cavity. So maybe \"carve\" and \"insert\" are the best choices. \n\nI think the answer should be \"carve; insert.\" Let me make sure there are no other words. \"Form\" isn't precise. So yes, those two are the synonyms.\n...done thinking.\n\ncarve; insert"
