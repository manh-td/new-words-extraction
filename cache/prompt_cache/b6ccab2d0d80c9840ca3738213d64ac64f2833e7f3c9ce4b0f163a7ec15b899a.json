  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"niche\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the verb \"niche\" and wants the answer in plain text, maximum two synonyms separated by semicolons. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the meaning of \"niche\" as a verb. From what I remember, \"niche\" can mean to create a niche for something, or to dig into something. So synonyms would be words that mean to create a space or to dig into. \n\nPossible synonyms could be \"dig into\" or \"create a space.\" Wait, \"dig into\" is more about peeling back layers, while \"create a space\" is more about forming a niche. But maybe \"dig into\" is more accurate. Alternatively, \"establish\" might work, but that's more about setting up. \n\nAnother thought: \"pierce\" could be a synonym, but that's more about cutting through. \"Form\" might also work, but that's more about shaping. \n\nSo between \"dig into\" and \"create a space,\" which is better? \"Dig into\" is more direct. \"Create a space\" is a bit more abstract. Maybe \"dig into\" is better. Let me check if \"dig into\" is commonly used as a synonym. Yes, in the context of creating a niche, \"dig into\" is used. \n\nSo the two synonyms would be \"dig into\" and \"create a space.\" But wait, the user wants maximum two, so maybe those are the two. Alternatively, \"pierce\" and \"form\" could work, but I think \"dig into\" is more accurate. \n\nI think the correct answer is \"dig into; create a space.\" But I need to make sure. Let me confirm. Another possibility is \"establish\" but that's more about setting up. So yeah, \"dig into\" and \"create a space\" are the best synonyms.\n...done thinking.\n\ndig into; create a space"
