  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bleaker\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"bleaker\" and they want the answer in plain text, only the antonyms, separated by semicolons if there are multiple. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"bleaker\" means. It's an adjective that describes something more severe or worse than usual. So antonyms would be words that mean less severe, more optimistic, or less extreme. \n\nThe primary antonym here is \"milder\" because \"bleaker\" means more severe, so \"milder\" would be less severe. Then there's \"better,\" which is another antonym. \"Better\" means more favorable, which fits. But wait, \"better\" is more commonly used in everyday language. \n\nAre there other possible antonyms? Maybe \"less severe\" but that's not an adjective. \"Cheerier\" is another possibility, but that's more about comfort than severity. So between \"milder\" and \"better,\" which is more accurate?\n\nIn standard dictionaries, \"milder\" is the direct antonym. \"Better\" is more of a comparative. So maybe the correct antonyms are \"milder\" and \"better.\" But I need to check if \"better\" is considered an antonym here. \n\nAlternatively, \"worse\" is an antonym, but that's more of a comparative. \"Worse\" is a bit more extreme. So maybe \"milder\" and \"better\" are the best choices. \n\nSo the answer should be \"milder; better\" separated by semicolons. Let me make sure there are no other antonyms. \"Smoother\" isn't really an antonym here. So yeah, those two are the correct antonyms.\n...done thinking.\n\nmilder; better"
