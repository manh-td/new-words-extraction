  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bleaker\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user asked for the antonyms of \"bleaker\" and I need to provide them. First, I should recall what \"bleaker\" means. It's an adjective that describes something more severe or worse than usual. So antonyms would be words that mean less severe, more hopeful, or less negative.\n\nCommon antonyms for \"bleaker\" might be \"milder\" or \"less severe\". Let me check if those are correct. \"Milder\" does mean less intense or less severe, so that's a good one. \"Less severe\" is also an antonym, but maybe the user wants more specific words. Another possibility could be \"better\" or \"warmer\", but those are more general. \n\nWait, the user specified antonyms, so I need to make sure. \"Milder\" and \"less severe\" are both valid. But maybe \"better\" is also an antonym? Hmm, \"better\" is more about quality, not necessarily severity. So perhaps \"milder\" and \"less severe\" are the best choices. \n\nI should check if there are any other common antonyms. \"Worse\" is a synonym, so that's not helpful. \"Cheerier\" might be a variant, but that's less common. The user asked for maximum two, so I can list both \"milder\" and \"less severe\". \n\nWait, the user said \"antonyms (maximum 2)\". So two is acceptable. So the answer would be \"milder; less severe\". But I need to make sure there's no mistake here. Let me confirm. Yes, \"milder\" and \"less severe\" are both antonyms. So that's the correct answer.\n...done thinking.\n\nmilder; less severe"
