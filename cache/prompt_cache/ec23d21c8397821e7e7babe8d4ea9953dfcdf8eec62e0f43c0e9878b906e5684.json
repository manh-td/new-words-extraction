  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"stifled\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"stifled\" as an adjective. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"stifled\" means. Stifled usually means to suppress or prevent something from happening, like a person being silenced or something being held back.\n\nSo, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. The opposite of stifled could be something like \"freed\" or \"unstifled\". Wait, but the user wants antonyms for an adjective. Let me think. If \"stifled\" is an adjective, then the antonyms would be words that describe something not stifled. So, \"freed\" is an antonym because it means released from restriction. Another possible antonym is \"unstifled\", which means not stifled. But I need to check if those are valid antonyms.\n\nAnother option could be \"unstifled\" or \"unstifled\". Let me verify. Yes, \"unstifled\" is an adjective meaning not stifled. So, the antonyms would be \"freed\" and \"unstifled\". But wait, \"freed\" is more about being released, while \"unstifled\" is about not being stifled. Both are valid antonyms. However, maybe the user expects a specific set. Let me check if there are other possible antonyms. Maybe \"unrestrained\" or \"unrestrained\", but that's more about not being controlled. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, \"unstifled\" is more direct. So, the two antonyms would be \"freed\" and \"unstifled\". But I need to make sure they are correct. Let me confirm. Yes, \"freed\" and \"unstifled\" are both antonyms. So the answer should be those two, joined by semicolons. The user asked for maximum 2, so that's acceptable.\n...done thinking.\n\nfreed; unstifled"
