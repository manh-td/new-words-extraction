  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"innate\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"innate\" as a verb. Let me start by recalling the meaning of \"innate\" as a verb. From what I know, \"innate\" means something that is present from birth or inherent. So, the antonyms would be things that are not inherent or not present by birth.\n\nNow, thinking about antonyms for \"innate\" as a verb. The word \"innate\" is often used in contexts like \"innate ability\" or \"innate trait.\" So, antonyms would be words that contradict this idea. Words like \"acquired\" come to mind because they mean something that is learned over time, which is the opposite of innate. Another possible antonym is \"learned,\" since that's another way of saying something that is not innate. \n\nWait, but the user specified \"antonyms\" and wants them in a single string separated by semicolons. Let me check if there are exactly two antonyms. \"Acquired\" and \"learned\" are both valid antonyms. Are there any others? Maybe \"acquired\" and \"learned\" are the main ones. I think that's it. So the answer should be \"acquired; learned\".\n...done thinking.\n\nacquired; learned"
