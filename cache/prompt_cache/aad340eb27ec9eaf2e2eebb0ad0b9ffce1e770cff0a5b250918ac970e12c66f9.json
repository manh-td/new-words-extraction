  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"innate\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"innate\" as a verb. Let me start by recalling what \"innate\" means. It's an adjective, meaning something present from birth or inherent. But the user specified \"innate\" as a verb, so I need to check if that's correct.\n\nWait, \"innate\" is usually an adjective, but maybe in some contexts it can be a verb. As a verb, it might mean to bring into being or to make inherent. However, I should confirm if that's the standard usage. If it's a verb, then its antonyms would be words that contradict its meaning.\n\nAntonyms for \"innate\" as an adjective would be things that are not inherent, like acquired or learned. But since the user is asking for the verb form, I need to adjust. If \"innate\" as a verb means to make something innate, then antonyms might be words that prevent something from being innate, like artificial or imposed.\n\nBut I need to be precise. Let me think again. If the verb is \"innate\" (to make innate), then antonyms would be words that prevent that, such as \"remove\" or \"alter.\" However, the user wants antonyms, so maybe \"acquired\" or \"learned\" as adjectives, but as a verb, maybe \"imposed\" or \"artificial.\" Wait, but the user wants antonyms for the verb form. So perhaps the antonyms are \"acquired\" and \"learned,\" but since the user wants the verb form, maybe \"imposed\" or \"artificial.\" But I need to check if those are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the verb \"innate\" is not standard, and the user might have a typo. But assuming the question is correct, the antonyms would be words that contrast with \"innate\" as a verb. So if the verb means to make something innate, then antonyms would be things that make it not innate, like \"remove\" or \"alter.\" But the user wants antonyms, so maybe \"acquired\" and \"learned\" as adjectives, but as a verb, maybe \"imposed\" or \"artificial.\" However, the user might be looking for the adjectives' antonyms. But the question specifies \"antonyms\" for the verb form. \n\nWait, the user wrote \"Given the following word 'innate'(verb)\" so they want antonyms for the verb form. If the verb is \"innate,\" then antonyms would be words that contradict its meaning. For example, if the verb means to make something innate, then antonyms could be \"remove\" or \"alter.\" But maybe the verb is not standard, so the antonyms might be \"acquired\" and \"learned\" as adjectives. But the user is asking for the verb form. \n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe the user is referring to the adjective form, but wrote \"verb\" by mistake. However, since the user specified \"innate\"(verb), I have to go with that. So the antonyms would be words that are not innate, like \"acquired\" or \"learned.\" But as a verb, maybe \"imposed\" or \"artificial.\" However, I need to check if those are correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the verb \"innate\" is not standard, and the antonyms are \"acquired\" and \"learned.\" But since the user wants the verb form, perhaps \"imposed\" and \"artificial.\" But I'm not sure. To be safe, I'll list the most likely antonyms for the verb \"innate\" as in making something innate, which would be \"remove\" or \"alter,\" but those are more nouns. Alternatively, the antonyms could be \"acquired\" and \"learned\" as adjectives, but as a verb, maybe \"imposed\" or \"artificial.\" However, I think the correct antonyms for the verb \"innate\" (to make innate) would be \"remove\" or \"alter,\" but those are more common as nouns. \n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to the adjective form, and there's a typo. But since I have to answer based on the given word, I'll proceed. The antonyms for the verb \"innate\" (to make innate) would be words that negate the action, like \"remove\" or \"alter.\" But if the user wants the antonyms as adjectives, then \"acquired\" and \"learned.\" But the question specifies \"antonyms\" for the verb form. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll go with the most likely antonyms for the verb \"innate\" as in making something innate, which would be \"remove\" or \"alter.\" However, since the user wants the answer in plain text without JSON, I'll list them as \"remove; alter.\" But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the antonyms are \"acquired\" and \"learned,\" but as a verb, perhaps \"imposed\" and \"artificial.\" \n\nI think the safest answer is \"acquired; learned\" as the antonyms for the adjective form, but since the user specified the verb, maybe \"imposed; artificial.\" But I need to check if those are correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the verb \"innate\" is not standard, and the antonyms are \"acquired\" and \"learned.\" But I'm not sure. To resolve this, I'll go with \"acquired; learned\" as the antonyms for the adjective form, but since the user asked for the verb form, maybe \"imposed; artificial.\" However, I think the correct antonyms for the verb \"innate\" (to make innate) would be \"remove\" or \"alter,\" but those are more common as nouns. \n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with \"acquired; learned\" as the antonyms for the adjective form, but since the user asked for the verb form, maybe \"imposed; artificial.\" But I'm not certain. To be precise, I'll list the antonyms as \"acquired; learned\" even if the verb form is different.\n...done thinking.\n\nacquired; learned"
