  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"menial\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for the antonyms of \"menial\" (an adjective). Let me start by recalling what \"menial\" means. It refers to someone who does menial tasks, usually considered low-status or menial work. So, the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of low-status or menial work.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that are opposite in meaning. \"Menial\" could be contrasted with something like \"elite\" or \"high-status.\" But wait, the user specified \"antonyms\" for an adjective. So, I need to find adjectives that oppose \"menial.\"\n\n\"Menial\" is an adjective, so the antonyms should also be adjectives. Words like \"elite\" or \"high-class\" come to mind. But \"elite\" is more about being in a high class, which might be a bit different. Another possible antonym is \"sophisticated,\" but that's more about complexity rather than status. \n\nWait, \"menial\" is often used in the context of low-status workers. So, the antonyms would be things that indicate high status or importance. \"Elite\" is a direct antonym. \"High-class\" is another, but maybe \"elite\" is more commonly used as an antonym. \n\nAre there other options? \"Senior\" or \"high-ranking\" could work, but those are more about rank than status. \"Elite\" is more about being in a high class. So, the two main antonyms would be \"elite\" and \"high-class.\" But the user wants the maximum of two, so I can list them as \"elite; high-class.\" \n\nI should check if \"high-class\" is commonly used as an antonym. It might be less common than \"elite,\" but it's still acceptable. Alternatively, \"upper-class\" could be another option, but \"elite\" is more concise. \n\nSo, the final answer should be \"elite; high-class\" or \"elite; upper-class.\" But since the user might prefer the most common, \"elite\" is better. Let me confirm. Yes, \"elite\" is the standard antonym for \"menial\" as an adjective. So the answer is \"elite; high-class.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nelite; high-class"
