  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"menial\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the word \"menial\" as an adjective and asked for its antonyms. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"menial\" means. From what I know, \"menial\" refers to someone who does menial or menial tasks, usually considered low-status or menial work. So, the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of a low-status, menial worker.\n\nThinking about antonyms for \"menial,\" the most obvious ones might be \"elite\" or \"high-status.\" But I should verify if these are accurate. \"Elite\" refers to the upper class, which is the opposite of menial. \"High-status\" is also a good antonym. Are there any other possible antonyms? Maybe \"professional\" or \"skilled,\" but those might not be exact antonyms. \"Professional\" could be considered a synonym in some contexts, so maybe not. \n\nWait, the user specified \"antonyms\" and wants up to two. So \"elite\" and \"high-status\" seem appropriate. I should check if these are commonly accepted. Yes, \"elite\" is a direct antonym, and \"high-status\" is also a valid one. So the answer should be \"elite; high-status\".\n...done thinking.\n\nelite; high-status"
