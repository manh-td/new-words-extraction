  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"niche\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for antonyms of the word \"niche\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to recall what the antonyms are. \"Niche\" means a small, distinct area or a specific position. So antonyms would be things that are not a niche. \n\nThe most obvious antonym is \"expanse\" because a niche is a small area, and an expanse is a large area. Then there's \"abode\" which means a place where someone lives, but that's more like a dwelling. Wait, maybe \"abode\" is not the best here. Another possibility is \"plain\" as in a flat area, but that's more general. \n\nWait, \"expanse\" seems accurate. \"Plain\" could work too, but maybe \"expanse\" is more directly opposite. Let me check. \"Niche\" is a small area, so \"expanse\" is a large area. \"Plain\" is a flat area, but maybe not as directly opposite. \n\nSo the two antonyms would be \"expanse\" and \"plain\". But I need to make sure. Another possible antonym is \"vast\", but that's more about size. \"Vast\" can mean large, but maybe not as precise. \n\nSo the best antonyms are \"expanse\" and \"plain\". Let me confirm. Yes, \"expanse\" is a clear antonym, and \"plain\" is also a large, open area. So the answer should be \"expanse; plain\".\n...done thinking.\n\nexpanse; plain"
