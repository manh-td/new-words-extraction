  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"niche\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"niche\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to recall what the synonyms and antonyms are for \"niche.\"\n\nThe word \"niche\" can mean a small, shallow depression or a place where something is placed. As a noun, it's often used to describe a specific area or a position. So antonyms would be words that contrast with \"niche.\"\n\nPossible antonyms could be \"void\" because a void is an empty space, which might be considered a kind of niche. Another one might be \"void\" again, but maybe \"space\" is also a contender. Wait, \"space\" is more general. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, \"slot\" is a synonym for niche in some contexts. But the user wants antonyms. So \"void\" and \"space\" could be antonyms. But I need to make sure. Another possibility is \"gap,\" but that's more about a space between things. \n\nWait, \"niche\" can also mean a small, shallow depression, so antonyms might be \"valley\" or \"valley\" as a noun. But \"valley\" is more of a larger feature. \n\nHmm, maybe the best antonyms are \"void\" and \"space.\" But I should verify. Let me think again. If \"niche\" is a small, specific area, then \"void\" (empty space) and \"space\" (a general area) could be antonyms. But \"space\" is more neutral. \n\nAlternatively, \"slot\" is a synonym. So the antonyms would be \"void\" and \"space.\" But I need to check if those are accurate. \n\nAnother angle: \"niche\" as in a specific position, so antonyms might be \"general\" or \"common,\" but those are more about the nature of the noun. \n\nWait, the user wants antonyms, so the most direct antonyms would be \"void\" and \"space.\" But I should make sure. Let me confirm. \n\nYes, \"void\" is an antonym because it's the opposite of a niche (a small space). \"Space\" is also an antonym because it's a larger area. So the answer should be \"void; space.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nvoid; space"
