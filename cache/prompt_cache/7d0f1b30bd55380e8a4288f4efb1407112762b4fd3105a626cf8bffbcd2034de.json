  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"impetuous\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"impetuous\" (an adjective). First, I need to recall what the antonyms are. Impetuous means acting without thinking, being hasty. So antonyms would be things that are thoughtful, deliberate, calm.\n\nCommon antonyms for impetuous could be \"calm\" and \"thoughtful\". Let me double-check. \"Calm\" means not easily disturbed, which fits. \"Thoughtful\" means considering things before acting. Both are valid antonyms. Are there any others? Maybe \"patient\" or \"moderate\"? Hmm, \"patient\" is more about endurance, but \"moderate\" is an adjective too. However, the user asked for antonyms, and \"patient\" is more about being slow, while \"moderate\" is about balance. But \"patient\" is a valid antonym. Wait, but the user wants maximum two. So maybe \"calm\" and \"thoughtful\" are the best ones. Alternatively, \"patient\" could be another. But I need to make sure. Let me check a dictionary. Yes, \"calm\" and \"thoughtful\" are standard antonyms. \"Patient\" is also sometimes used, but maybe the most direct ones are \"calm\" and \"thoughtful\". So the answer should be \"calm; thoughtful\".\n...done thinking.\n\ncalm; thoughtful"
