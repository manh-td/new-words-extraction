  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"impetuous\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user wants the antonyms of the word \"impetuous\" (an adjective). Let me think. Impetuous means acting without thought, being hasty. So antonyms would be things that are thoughtful, deliberate, calm.\n\nFirst, \"calm\" comes to mind. It's the opposite of hasty. Then there's \"thoughtful\" which describes someone who is careful and considers things before acting. Are there any others? Maybe \"deliberate\"? That's another way of saying slow in decision-making. But the user asked for maximum two, so maybe \"calm\" and \"thoughtful\" are the best ones. Let me check if those are standard antonyms. Yes, \"calm\" is often used for opposite of impetuous, and \"thoughtful\" is a good antonym too. So the answer should be \"calm; thoughtful\".\n...done thinking.\n\ncalm; thoughtful"
