  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"grain\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the verb \"grain\" and wants the answer in plain text, maximum two synonyms separated by semicolons. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the verb \"grain\" correctly. The verb \"grain\" can mean to grind into powder, like grinding grain into flour, or it can mean to make a grain of sand, like \"to grain the sand.\" But the most common synonym here is \"grind.\" So \"grind\" is a direct synonym.\n\nWait, are there other synonyms? Let me check. Sometimes \"grain\" can also mean to make into a powder, but \"grind\" is the primary synonym. Another possible synonym might be \"mash,\" but that's more general. \"Grind\" is more specific. So the best answer is \"grind.\" But the user asked for maximum two synonyms. Since there's only one, I can just list it. But maybe there's another one. Let me think again. \"Grind\" is the main one. Are there any other common synonyms? Maybe \"crush,\" but that's more about pressing down. \"Grind\" is more about reducing to a powder. So I think \"grind\" is the only synonym. So the answer should be \"grind.\"\n...done thinking.\n\ngrind"
