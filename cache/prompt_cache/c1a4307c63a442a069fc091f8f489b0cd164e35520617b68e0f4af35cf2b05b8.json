  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"oar\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the word \"oar\" as a verb. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the verb form correctly. \"Oar\" as a verb means to row a boat, right? So the sentences should involve rowing a boat.\n\nHmm, maybe something like \"She oared through the calm lake.\" That's straightforward. Then another one could be \"The fishermen oared their boat to the shore.\" Wait, does \"oared\" fit here? Yes, because it's the past tense. But the user said maximum two sentences, so maybe that's okay. Let me check if there's a better way. Maybe \"The boat oared by the river.\" But that's a bit vague. The first example is good. The second one is clear. I think those two sentences work.\n...done thinking.\n\noared through the calm lake; the fishermen oared their boat to the shore"
