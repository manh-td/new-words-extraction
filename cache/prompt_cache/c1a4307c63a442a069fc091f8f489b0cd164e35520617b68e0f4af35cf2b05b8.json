  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"oar\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the word \"oar\" as a verb. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the verb form correctly. An oar is a tool used to row a boat, so as a verb, it means to row. \n\nSo, the first sentence could be something like \"The fishermen used an oar to row their boat across the lake.\" That's straightforward. The second sentence might need to show a different context. Maybe something involving a boat in a different setting. Like \"The crew rowed the boat carefully through the rapids.\" That uses the verb in a different scenario. \n\nWait, I should check if the verbs are correctly used. \"Row\" is the base form, so \"rowed\" is past tense. The examples should be correct. Also, make sure the sentences are simple and clear. No need for complex sentences. Just two sentences, each using \"oar\" as a verb. Alright, that should work.\n...done thinking.\n\noar; the fishermen used an oar to row their boat across the lake; oar; the crew rowed the boat carefully through the rapids"
