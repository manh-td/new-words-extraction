  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"transfixed\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to provide two example sentences using the word \"transfixed\" as an adjective. Let me think about how to structure them.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure the sentences are correct and use the word in context. \"Transfixed\" means completely amazed or bewildered. So maybe something like \"The audience was transfixed by the performer's amazing act.\" That works. \n\nAnother example could be \"She was transfixed by the beauty of the sunset.\" That's another common scenario. I should check if these sentences are natural and fit the meaning. Also, ensure that the sentences are short and only use the word once each. \n\nWait, the user specified maximum two sentences, so I need to stick to two. Let me verify the examples again. Yes, both sentences use \"transfixed\" correctly. No markdown, just plain text. Alright, that should do it.\n...done thinking.\n\ntransfixed; The audience was transfixed by the performer's amazing act.  \ntransfixed; She was transfixed by the beauty of the sunset."
