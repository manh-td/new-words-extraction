  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"uncanny\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"uncanny\" as an English dictionary assistant. Let me think. Uncanny means surprising or strange in a way that's almost eerie. So synonyms could be things like strange, eerie, or supernatural. Wait, but the user wants maximum two synonyms. Let me check if \"strange\" is a good synonym. Yes, it's often used. Then \"eerie\" is another common word. But sometimes \"eerie\" is more specific to something unsettling. Alternatively, \"strange\" is more general. So maybe \"strange; eerie\"? Or \"eerie; strange\"? Either way, they're both valid. I should check if there are any other common synonyms. Maybe \"marvelous\" isn't right because it's more positive. \"Unusual\" could work, but it's a bit different. So the best two would be \"strange\" and \"eerie\". Let me make sure they're correct. Yes, those are standard synonyms. So the answer should be \"strange; eerie\".\n...done thinking.\n\nstrange; eerie"
