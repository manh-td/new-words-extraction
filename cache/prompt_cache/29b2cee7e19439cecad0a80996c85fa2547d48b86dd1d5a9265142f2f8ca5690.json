  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"uncanny\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"uncanny\" as an English dictionary assistant. Let me think. Uncanny means causing a sense of something strange or supernatural. So synonyms could be words that convey a similar feeling.\n\nFirst, \"strange\" comes to mind. It's a direct synonym. Then \"weird\" is another common word people use when something is uncanny. Both are valid. I should check if they're commonly accepted. Yeah, both are used in everyday language. So the answer should be \"strange; weird\". Let me make sure there aren't any other synonyms. Maybe \"odd\" or \"unusual\"? But \"odd\" is more about being different, while \"uncanny\" is more about the strange or supernatural. So \"strange\" and \"weird\" are the best choices here. Alright, that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nstrange; weird"
