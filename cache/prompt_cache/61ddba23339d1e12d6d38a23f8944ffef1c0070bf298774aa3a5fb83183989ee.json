  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"anthropologist\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"anthropologist\" as a noun. Let me think. An anthropologist is someone who studies humans, so synonyms would be people who study human societies or cultures. Maybe \"cultural anthropologist\" is a specific type, but the question is for synonyms in general. Another term could be \"human scientist\" or \"sociologist\" since they also study humans. But wait, a sociologist focuses more on society and social behavior, while an anthropologist might cover a broader range, including culture, biology, and society. So \"sociologist\" could be a synonym. But I need to check if that's accurate. Alternatively, \"humanist\" is another term, but that's more about humanities. Hmm. The most direct synonyms would be \"cultural anthropologist\" and \"human scientist\". But the user wants maximum two, so maybe \"cultural anthropologist; human scientist\". But I should make sure these are correct. Another possibility is \"ethnologist\", but that's a specific subfield. So the best answer is \"cultural anthropologist; human scientist\".\n...done thinking.\n\ncultural anthropologist; human scientist"
