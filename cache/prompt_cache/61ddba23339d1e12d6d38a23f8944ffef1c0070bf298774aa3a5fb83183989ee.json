  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"anthropologist\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"anthropologist\" (noun). Let me think. An anthropologist studies human societies and cultures. Synonyms could be someone who studies humans, like human学家 or ethnologist. Wait, ethnologist is more specific to cultural studies, but anthropologist does cover a broader range. So maybe \"human学家\" is a good synonym. Another option is \"cultural historian,\" but that's more specific. The user wants nouns, so \"human学家\" fits better. Let me check if there's another common term. Maybe \"sociologist\" but that's more about society in general. So the best synonyms would be \"human学家\" and \"ethnologist.\" But I need to make sure they're accurate. Alternatively, \"cultural anthropologist\" is a specific type, but the general term is anthropologist. So the main synonyms are human学家 and ethnologist. Join them with semicolons. Let me confirm again. Yes, those are the most accurate synonyms.\n...done thinking.\n\nhuman学家; ethnologist"
