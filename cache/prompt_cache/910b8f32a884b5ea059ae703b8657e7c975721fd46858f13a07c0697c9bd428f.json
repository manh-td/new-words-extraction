  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"eminently\"(adverb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"eminently\" as an adverb. Let me think. \"Eminently\" means in a way that is especially good or excellent. So synonyms could be words that mean excellent or very good. Words like \"excellently\" come to mind because that's a direct synonym. Another one might be \"exceptionally,\" which also means in a way that is beyond ordinary. Wait, but the user specified \"adverb,\" so \"exceptionally\" is an adverb. Another option is \"superlatively,\" but that's less common. Maybe \"unquestionably\" isn't right. Let me check again. \"Excellently\" and \"exceptionally\" are both adverbs. So the answer should be those two. I need to make sure they're correct. Yes, both are adverbs and mean very good. So the synonyms are \"excellently; exceptionally\".\n...done thinking.\n\nexcellently; exceptionally"
