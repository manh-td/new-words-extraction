  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"eminently\"(adverb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"eminently\" as an adverb. Let me start by recalling what \"eminently\" means. It's an adverb that means in a way that is especially good or excellent. So, synonyms would be words that convey the same meaning.\n\nFirst, I need to think of adverbs that mean \"very well\" or \"excellently.\" Words like \"excellently\" come to mind. That's a direct synonym. Then there's \"superlatively,\" which is another adverb that means in a superlative sense, but I'm not sure if that's considered a standard synonym here. Sometimes \"superlatively\" is used in literary contexts, but maybe the user wants more common synonyms.\n\nAnother possibility is \"remarkably,\" but that's more about surprising or unexpected. Not exactly the same. \"Exceptionally\" is another one, which does mean in a way that is especially good. So that's another synonym.\n\nWait, the user specified \"adverb,\" so all three of these are adverbs. But the question says maximum 2. So maybe \"excellently\" and \"superlatively\" are the top two. But I need to check if \"superlatively\" is considered a standard synonym. Alternatively, \"remarkably\" might not fit as well. \n\nAlternatively, \"eminently\" can also be synonymous with \"exceptionally\" or \"excellently.\" So maybe the best two are \"excellently\" and \"exceptionally.\" But the user might prefer the more common ones. Let me verify. \n\nYes, \"excellently\" and \"exceptionally\" are both common synonyms for \"eminently.\" \"Superlatively\" is less common. So the answer should be \"excellently; exceptionally.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nexcellently; exceptionally"
