  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bleaker\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"bleaker\" (an adjective). Let me think. First, I need to recall what \"bleaker\" means. It describes something that is more severe or worse than usual. So synonyms would be words that convey a similar meaning.\n\nI remember that \"dreary\" is often used to describe something bleak, like a dull or desolate place. Another possible synonym is \"desolate,\" which also means lonely or empty, which can fit the idea of something bleak. Wait, but \"desolate\" is more about being empty or lonely, while \"dreary\" is more about being dull or uninviting. Both could work, but maybe \"dreary\" is more directly synonymous.\n\nAre there other options? \"Miserable\" is an adjective, but it's more about feeling than the state of being bleak. \"Worse\" is an adverb, so maybe not. \"Severe\" is another possibility, but it's more about the intensity of the situation. \n\nSo the two best synonyms here are \"dreary\" and \"desolate.\" But I need to check if they are commonly accepted. \"Dreary\" is often used in literature, and \"desolate\" is a standard adjective. So I'll go with those two. The user wants maximum two synonyms, so I can list them as separate. But wait, the instruction says to join them into a single string separated by semicolons. So it should be \"dreary; desolate\".\n...done thinking.\n\ndreary; desolate"
