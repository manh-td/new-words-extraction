  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"embroiled\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user wants synonyms for \"embroiled\" as a verb. First, I need to recall what \"embroiled\" means. It's to be deeply involved or engaged in something, right? So synonyms would be words that mean the same thing.\n\nHmm, \"involved\" comes to mind. That's a direct synonym. Then there's \"entangled,\" which also means to be deeply involved, especially in a complicated situation. Wait, is \"entangled\" a synonym here? Let me check. Both words convey being deeply engaged, so yes. \n\nAre there any others? Maybe \"caught up\" but that's more about being involved in a situation. \"Engaged\" is a bit more general. So the best ones are \"involved\" and \"entangled\". I should list them separated by semicolons. Let me make sure there's no mistake. Yep, those are the standard synonyms. Alright, that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\ninvolved; entangled"
