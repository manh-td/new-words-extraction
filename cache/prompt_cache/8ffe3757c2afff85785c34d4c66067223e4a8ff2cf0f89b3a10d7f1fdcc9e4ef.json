  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"embroiled\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"embroiled\" as a verb. Let me start by recalling what \"embroiled\" means. It means to be deeply involved or entangled in a situation, often in a complicated or difficult way.\n\nSo, I need to think of other verbs that have similar meanings. Let me brainstorm. Words like \"involved\" come to mind, but that's more of a noun. \"Caught up\" is another possibility, but that's more about being in a situation. \"Stuck\" might work, but that's more about being immobilized. \"Tangled\" is a good synonym, as it implies being in a complicated situation. \"Engaged\" is also possible, but that's more about being involved in an activity. \n\nWait, \"embroiled\" can also be used in the sense of being in a complex situation. So \"complicated\" might be a synonym, but that's an adjective. The user asked for synonyms as a verb, so maybe \"tangled\" and \"involved\" are better. Let me check if those are accurate. \"Tangled\" does fit, as in being entangled. \"Involved\" is more general. \n\nI should make sure there aren't any other common synonyms. \"Stuck\" might be too simple. \"Engaged\" is more about being in an activity. So the best synonyms would be \"tangled\" and \"involved\". Let me confirm by checking a thesaurus. Yes, \"tangled\" and \"involved\" are indeed synonyms for \"embroiled\" as a verb. So the answer should be those two.\n...done thinking.\n\ntangled; involved"
