  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"innate\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of the word \"innate\" as a verb. Let me start by recalling what \"innate\" means. It refers to something present at birth or inherent in an organism. As a verb, it might mean to be born with or to have from birth.\n\nNow, I need to think of synonyms for \"innate\" as a verb. Let me brainstorm. Words like \"natural\" come to mind because they imply something inherent. Another possible synonym is \"inherent,\" which directly relates to being present at birth. Wait, \"inherent\" is more about being part of something, whereas \"natural\" is about being common or occurring without effort. \n\nAre there any other words? \"Acquired\" is the opposite, so that's not helpful. \"Original\" might work, but I'm not sure if that's a direct synonym. \"Inborn\" is another possibility, but that's more of an adjective. \n\nSo the top choices are \"natural\" and \"inherent.\" Let me check if these are accurate. \"Inherent\" is a direct synonym for \"innate\" as a verb. \"Natural\" is a bit more general, but it can be used in this context. \n\nThe user asked for maximum two synonyms. So I should list both. But I need to make sure they are correct. \"Inherent\" is definitely a synonym. \"Natural\" is also acceptable. So the answer would be \"natural; inherent.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nnatural; inherent"
