  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"innate\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"innate\" as a verb. Let me start by recalling what \"innate\" means. It's an adjective, meaning something present from birth or inherent. But the user specified \"innate\" as a verb, which is a bit confusing because that's not the standard usage. However, I should proceed with the given information.\n\nFirst, I need to think of verbs that mean something inherent or natural. Words like \"inherent\" come to mind, but that's more of an adjective. Maybe \"natural\" is a verb? Wait, \"natural\" as a verb means to make something natural. But does that fit the definition of innate? Maybe. Then there's \"intrinsic,\" which is an adjective meaning something inherent. But the user wants synonyms as a verb. \n\nAnother possibility is \"original,\" but that's more about origin. \"Inherent\" is closer. So the possible synonyms would be \"inherent\" and \"natural.\" But I need to check if \"natural\" can be used as a verb here. If \"innate\" is being used as a verb, then \"natural\" might be a valid synonym. \n\nWait, maybe \"inherent\" is the primary synonym. \"Natural\" could also work. So the answer would be \"inherent; natural.\" But I should make sure that both are acceptable as verbs. \"Natural\" as a verb does mean to make something natural, which aligns with the idea of something innate. So yes, those are the synonyms.\n...done thinking.\n\ninherent; natural"
