  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"geodesic\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for antonyms of the word \"geodesic\" (an adjective). First, I need to make sure I understand what a geodesic is. From what I remember, a geodesic is a path that gives the shortest distance between two points on a surface, like a straight line on a sphere. So, it's a concept from geometry.\n\nNow, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. What comes to mind? Well, \"geodesic\" relates to the shortest path, so maybe something that's not the shortest path. Words like \"arbitrary\" or \"random\" come to mind, but are those antonyms? Wait, \"arbitrary\" means not following a specific rule, but maybe not exactly the opposite of geodesic. \n\nAnother thought: \"geodesic\" can also refer to a path on a surface, so the opposite might be something like \"zigzag\" or \"curved,\" but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The antonym of \"geodesic\" in the context of shortest paths would be something like \"non-optimal\" or \"non-straight,\" but those might not be standard. \n\nWait, maybe \"geodesic\" is also related to \"straight lines\" in a specific context. So, the antonym could be \"non-straight\" or \"non-geodesic.\" But the user wants antonyms, so maybe \"non-geodesic\" is the direct antonym. But the user specified \"antonyms\" and wants them in a string separated by semicolons. \n\nI need to check if there are standard antonyms. Let me think. In geometry, the opposite of a geodesic would be a path that isn't the shortest, so maybe \"non-geodesic.\" But is that considered an antonym? Alternatively, maybe \"arbitrary\" or \"random,\" but those are more about choice than path. \n\nAnother angle: \"geodesic\" can be a noun, but here it's an adjective. So, the antonym might be \"non-geodesic,\" but that's a bit of a tautology. Maybe \"non-optimal\" or \"non-straight.\" However, the most accurate antonym in this context would be \"non-geodesic,\" but I'm not sure if that's considered an antonym. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"geodesic\" is related to \"straight lines,\" so the antonym could be \"curved\" or \"non-straight.\" But I need to be precise. \n\nWait, the user might be looking for words that directly oppose the meaning of \"geodesic.\" If \"geodesic\" refers to the shortest path, then the antonym would be something that isn't the shortest path. So, \"non-optimal\" or \"non-straight.\" But I need to check standard dictionaries. \n\nLooking up antonyms for \"geodesic\" in a thesaurus, maybe \"geodesic\" is opposite of \"non-geodesic,\" but that's a tautology. Alternatively, \"geodesic\" could be opposite of \"arbitrary\" or \"random,\" but that's not directly related. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is \"non-geodesic\" and \"non-straight,\" but I'm not sure. However, the user wants maximum two antonyms. So, perhaps \"non-geodesic\" and \"non-straight.\" But I need to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"geodesic\" is also related to \"straight lines,\" so the antonym could be \"non-straight.\" But I think the most accurate antonym here is \"non-geodesic,\" even if it's a tautology. \n\nSo, the answer would be \"non-geodesic; non-straight.\" But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe \"non-geodesic\" is the only valid antonym. \n\nWait, the user might be expecting \"non-geodesic\" as the antonym, but since the question says \"antonyms\" and allows up to two, maybe \"non-geodesic\" and \"non-straight.\" But I'm not sure. \n\nIn conclusion, the most accurate antonyms would be \"non-geodesic\" and \"non-straight,\" but I need to check if \"non-straight\" is a valid antonym. Alternatively, \"arbitrary\" or \"random\" could be considered, but I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the context, I'll go with \"non-geodesic\" and \"non-straight\" as the antonyms.\n...done thinking.\n\nnon-geodesic; non-straight"
