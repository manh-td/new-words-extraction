  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"geodesic\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for antonyms of the word \"geodesic\" (an adjective). First, I need to make sure I understand what a geodesic is. From what I remember, a geodesic is a path that gives the shortest distance between two points on a surface, like a straight line on a sphere. So, it's a concept from geometry.\n\nNow, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. What comes to mind? Well, \"geodesic\" relates to the shortest path, so antonyms might be things that are not the shortest path. For example, \"arbitrary\" or \"non-optimal\"? Wait, but the user specified \"antonyms\" and wants them in a string separated by semicolons.\n\nI should think of the most direct antonyms. \"Geodesic\" is about shortest paths, so antonyms could be \"non-geodesic,\" but that's a bit of a tautology. Maybe \"non-optimal\" or \"non-straight\"? Wait, but \"non-straight\" isn't exactly an antonym. Let me think again.\n\nAnother angle: in the context of geometry, a geodesic is a straight line on a surface. So, antonyms might be things like \"curved\" or \"non-straight.\" But \"curved\" is more about the shape of the path, whereas \"non-straight\" is about the path not being straight. However, \"non-straight\" is more of a negation. \n\nWait, the user wants antonyms. So, if \"geodesic\" is about the shortest path, then antonyms could be \"non-geodesic,\" but that's a bit redundant. Maybe \"non-optimal\" or \"non-straight.\" But I need to check if these are valid antonyms.\n\nAlternatively, in some contexts, \"geodesic\" could refer to a path that's not the shortest, but that's more of a related concept. So, the direct antonyms would be \"non-geodesic\" and \"non-straight.\" But I need to confirm if \"non-straight\" is an accepted antonym.\n\nWait, maybe \"geodesic\" is also related to \"straight line,\" so the antonym could be \"curved\" or \"non-straight.\" But \"curved\" is more about the shape of the path, while \"non-straight\" is about the path not being straight. However, \"non-straight\" is a more direct antonym.\n\nSo, compiling the antonyms: \"non-geodesic\" and \"non-straight.\" But the user asked for maximum 2, so maybe those two. But I need to check if \"non-straight\" is considered an antonym. Alternatively, maybe \"non-geodesic\" is the primary antonym, and \"non-straight\" is a related term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the antonyms are \"non-geodesic\" and \"non-optimal.\" But I'm not sure. Let me think again. In the context of geometry, a geodesic is the shortest path, so the antonym would be something that is not the shortest path. So, \"non-geodesic\" is a direct antonym. But maybe \"non-straight\" is also an antonym. However, \"non-straight\" is more about the path not being straight, which is a different aspect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"arbitrary\" is an antonym, but that's not directly related. So, perhaps the best antonyms are \"non-geodesic\" and \"non-straight.\" But I need to make sure that these are valid antonyms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"geodesic\" is used in a different context, like in the sense of a path that's not the shortest, so \"non-geodesic\" is the antonym. But I think \"non-straight\" is also a valid antonym. However, the user might expect \"non-geodesic\" as the main antonym, and \"non-straight\" as a related one.\n\nSo, the answer would be \"non-geodesic; non-straight.\" But I need to check if \"non-straight\" is considered an antonym. Alternatively, maybe \"non-geodesic\" is the only valid antonym, and \"non-straight\" is a related term. But the user wants antonyms, so both could be included.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"geodesic\" is also related to \"straight line,\" so the antonym would be \"curved,\" but that's more of a related term. \n\nHmm, perhaps the best answer is \"non-geodesic; non-straight.\" But I need to confirm if \"non-straight\" is an accepted antonym. In some contexts, \"non-straight\" could be considered an antonym, but it's more of a negation. However, the user might accept both.\n\nSo, the final answer would be \"non-geodesic; non-straight.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nnon-geodesic; non-straight"
