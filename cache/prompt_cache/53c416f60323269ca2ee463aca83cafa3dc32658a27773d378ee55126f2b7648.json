  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"snub\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for antonyms of the word \"snub\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"snub\" means. As a noun, \"snub\" refers to a slight insult or a act of being rude, especially towards someone you know.\n\nNow, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. So, what are the opposite of a slight insult or a rude act? Words like \"respect\" come to mind, but that's more of an adjective. Maybe \"courtesy\"? Wait, \"courtesy\" is an adjective too. But the user might be looking for nouns. \n\nAnother possibility is \"compliment,\" but that's more about a positive gesture. Hmm. \"Honour\" could be a noun, but that's more about respect. \"Praise\" is also a noun, but that's a positive. \n\nWait, maybe \"respect\" is the best antonym here. But I need to check if there are other common antonyms. \"Honour\" is a possible one. So, the antonyms would be \"respect\" and \"honour\". But I should verify if these are correct. \n\nAlternatively, \"compliment\" might be considered, but it's more of a positive. The user specified \"antonyms\" and the word is a noun. So, \"respect\" and \"honour\" are more accurate. Let me make sure there aren't any other common nouns that fit. \"Praise\" is a noun, but it's more about positive. \"Esteem\" is another possibility, but that's an adjective. \n\nSo, the most accurate antonyms for \"snub\" as a noun are \"respect\" and \"honour\". I'll list them separated by semicolons as required.\n...done thinking.\n\nrespect; honour"
