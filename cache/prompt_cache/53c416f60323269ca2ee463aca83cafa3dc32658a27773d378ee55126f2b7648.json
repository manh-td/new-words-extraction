  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"snub\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for antonyms of the word \"snub\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"snub\" means. From what I know, \"snub\" can mean to insult someone, especially in a polite or formal way, or to make someone feel inferior. It's often used in contexts like being put down or ridiculed.\n\nNow, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. So, what's the opposite of \"snub\"? Let's think. If you snub someone, you're treating them unfairly. The opposite would be treating them with respect or kindness. So words like \"respect\" or \"treating with dignity\" come to mind. But the user wants antonyms, so maybe \"respect\" is the primary one. Another possible antonym could be \"esteem,\" which means high regard. But I need to check if those are considered antonyms here.\n\nWait, the user specified \"antonyms (maximum 2)\". So maybe two words. Let me think again. \"Respect\" and \"esteem\" are both synonyms in some contexts, but \"esteem\" is more about high regard, while \"respect\" is more about acknowledging someone's worth. Both could be considered antonyms to \"snub,\" which is about insulting or putting someone down. \n\nAlternatively, \"honour\" might be another option, but I'm not sure if that's the most direct antonym. Let me verify. \"Snub\" can also mean to make someone feel inferior, so antonyms would be things that counter that. \"Respect\" and \"esteem\" are the most direct. So the answer should be \"respect; esteem\" or \"respect; honour\" depending on the exact meanings. But I think \"respect\" and \"esteem\" are more accurate. Let me check if \"esteem\" is considered an antonym here. Yes, it's the opposite of disrespect. So the two antonyms would be \"respect\" and \"esteem\". \n\nI need to make sure there are only two, and they are separated by semicolons. So the final answer would be \"respect; esteem\".\n...done thinking.\n\nrespect; esteem"
