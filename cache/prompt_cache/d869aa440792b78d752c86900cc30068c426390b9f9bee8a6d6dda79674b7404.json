  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"maneuvers\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"maneuvers\" when it's used as a verb. Let me start by recalling what \"maneuvers\" means. It refers to the actions taken to guide or control something, like a ship or an aircraft. So, synonyms would be words that mean the same thing.\n\nFirst, I think of \"operations\" because operations can involve planning and executing actions. Then there's \"actions\" as a synonym, but I need to make sure that's accurate. Wait, \"maneuvers\" can also be part of a larger context, like \"maneuvers in a battle,\" so maybe \"moves\" is another option. But \"moves\" is more general. \n\nAnother possibility is \"strategies,\" but that's more about planning than the actual actions. Let me check a dictionary. Synonyms for \"maneuver\" as a verb include \"operate,\" \"conduct,\" \"execute,\" \"carry out,\" \"perform,\" \"conduct operations,\" \"execute maneuvers,\" etc. So the most direct synonyms would be \"operations\" and \"actions.\" \n\nBut the user wants maximum two synonyms. So I should list them as \"operations; actions.\" Wait, \"actions\" might not be the best synonym. \"Operations\" is more specific to the planned actions. \"Perform\" is another possible, but maybe the user wants more direct synonyms. \n\nI think the best answer is \"operations; actions.\" Let me confirm. Yes, \"operations\" and \"actions\" are both valid synonyms for \"maneuvers\" as a verb. So that's the answer.\n...done thinking.\n\noperations; actions"
