  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"complacency\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of \"complacency\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what complacency means. It's when someone is satisfied with their current situation, often to the point of being indifferent or uninterested in improvement.\n\nSo, I need to think of other nouns that mean something similar. Words like \"contentment\" come to mind because they involve satisfaction. Then there's \"satisfaction\" as a noun, which is a direct synonym. Are there any others? Maybe \"indifference\" but that's more about lack of interest rather than the state of being satisfied. \"Arrogance\" might be a stretch, but sometimes people use it to describe a complacent attitude. Wait, but the user specified \"noun,\" so \"arrogance\" is a noun. But I should check if that's considered a synonym here. \n\nHmm, \"contentment\" and \"satisfaction\" are more direct. \"Indifference\" is more about lack of interest, which might not be exactly the same. So the best synonyms would be \"contentment\" and \"satisfaction.\" Let me make sure there aren't any other common ones. \"Delight\" is an adjective, so not applicable here. \"Happiness\" is also an adjective. So yeah, contentment and satisfaction are the main ones. I should present them as the answer, joined by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\nsatisfaction; contentment"
