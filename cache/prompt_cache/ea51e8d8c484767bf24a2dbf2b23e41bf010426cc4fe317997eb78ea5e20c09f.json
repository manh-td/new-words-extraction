  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"complacency\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of \"complacency\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what complacency means. It refers to a state of contentment or satisfaction, often implying that something is too good to be true or that one is not striving towards a goal.\n\nSo, I need to think of other nouns that mean the same thing. Words like \"contentment\" come to mind because they describe a state of satisfaction. Another possible synonym might be \"satisfaction,\" but I should check if that's considered a noun here. Wait, \"satisfaction\" is indeed a noun. \n\nAre there any other words? \"Contentment\" is a good one. \"Content\" as a noun can also be used, but maybe the user wants more specific synonyms. Let me verify. \"Contentment\" is a direct synonym, and \"satisfaction\" is another. Both are valid nouns. \n\nI should make sure there aren't any other common synonyms. \"Ease\" isn't a noun here. \"Content\" as a noun is acceptable, but maybe the user wants more standard synonyms. So the top two would be \"contentment\" and \"satisfaction.\" \n\nI need to present them as a single string separated by semicolons. So the answer would be \"contentment;satisfaction\".\n...done thinking.\n\ncontentment;satisfaction"
