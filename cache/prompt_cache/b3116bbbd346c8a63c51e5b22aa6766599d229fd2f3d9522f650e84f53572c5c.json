  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"tactile\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the word \"tactile\" as an adjective. Let me think about how to use it correctly.\n\nFirst, \"tactile\" describes something that can be felt, like touch. So maybe something related to touch or sensation. Maybe a surface that's tactile? Like a texture. Oh, \"tactile surfaces\" could be an example. That's straightforward.\n\nAnother sentence could be about something that's tactile in nature. Like a tool that's tactile. Maybe a wrench? \"The wrench is a tactile tool that helps in tightening bolts.\" Wait, but \"tactile\" as an adjective here would mean it's touch-sensitive. So maybe \"The texture of the material is tactile, allowing you to feel the ridges.\" That uses it as an adjective describing the texture.\n\nWait, the user said maximum two sentences. Let me check if those examples are correct. The first sentence about tactile surfaces is good. The second one about the texture being tactile. Yeah, that works. I need to make sure the sentences are correct and use the word properly. No need for explanations, just the sentences. Alright, formatted as requested.\n...done thinking.\n\ntactile surfaces; the texture of the material is tactile, allowing you to feel the ridges."
