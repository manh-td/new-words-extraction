  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to provide two example sentences using the word \"propel\" as a verb. Let me think of common contexts. Maybe something scientific, like moving a car or a ship. Then another one could be about motivating people. Let me check if those make sense.

I need to make sure they're valid and not too similar. Yeah, that should do it.\n...done thinking.\n\npropelled the boat across the river; propelled her to win the race"
