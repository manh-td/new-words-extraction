  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"propel\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the word \"propel\" as a verb. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I use the correct form. \"Propel\" is the base form, so the sentences should use it in the present tense.\n\nMaybe start with something like \"The engine propelled the boat forward.\" That's straightforward. Then another sentence could be \"She propelled the car into the driveway.\" Both sentences use \"propel\" in the present tense. I should check if they're correct and if they make sense. Yeah, those seem to work. No need for any extra explanation since the user wants just the sentences.\n...done thinking.\n\nThe engine propelled the boat forward; she propelled the car into the driveway."
