  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"attestation\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"attestation\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what attestation means. It's a formal act of verifying something, like a document or a statement. So, synonyms would be words that mean the same thing.\n\nFirst, I think of \"verification\" because attestation involves confirming the truth of something. Then there's \"certification,\" which is similar because it's about confirming something is valid. Are there any others? Maybe \"endorsement\"? Hmm, that's more about approving something, but it can be a synonym in some contexts. Wait, the user specified \"noun,\" so maybe \"endorsement\" is acceptable. But I need to check if it's commonly used as a noun here.\n\nAnother possibility is \"declaration,\" but that's more about stating a fact. \"Verification\" is more about the process, while \"certification\" is about the act of confirming. \"Endorsement\" is more about approval, which might be a bit different. Let me verify. \n\nIn legal or formal contexts, \"certification\" and \"verification\" are both used. \"Endorsement\" can be a synonym in some cases, but maybe it's less direct. The user wants maximum two synonyms. So, between verification and certification. Maybe \"verification\" is better. But I should check if \"certification\" is considered a synonym here. \n\nI think the best answer is \"verification; certification.\" That's two synonyms. Let me make sure there's no other common ones. \"Affirmation\" might be too informal. \"Sanction\" is more about approval but not exactly the same. So yeah, verification and certification are the top choices.\n...done thinking.\n\nverification; certification"
