  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"attestation\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"attestation\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what attestation means. It's a formal act of verifying something, like a document or a statement. So synonyms would be words that mean the same thing.\n\nFirst, I think of \"verification\" because attestation involves confirming the truth of something. Then there's \"certification\" which is similar, as it's about confirming something is valid. Are there any others? Maybe \"endorsement\"? Hmm, that's more about approving, but it can be a synonym. Wait, but the user specified \"noun,\" so I need to make sure those are nouns. Verification and certification are both nouns. Endorsement is also a noun. But maybe the most common ones are verification and certification. Let me check if those are accurate. Yes, attestation is the process of verifying, so verification makes sense. Certification is when something is officially recognized. So the two best synonyms would be verification and certification. I should present them as a single string separated by semicolons. Let me make sure there's no error in the list. No, that's correct.\n...done thinking.\n\nverification; certification"
