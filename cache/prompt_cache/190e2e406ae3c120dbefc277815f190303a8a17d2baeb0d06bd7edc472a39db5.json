  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"chastened\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to create two example sentences using the word \"chastened\" as an adjective. Let me think about how to use it correctly.\n\nFirst, \"chastened\" means made sorry or embarrassed by someone's actions. So, maybe something like a person being embarrassed after a mistake. \n\nSentence 1: She felt chastened when she realized she had made a mistake in front of the group. That works because it shows the emotion of embarrassment.\n\nSentence 2: The teacher chastened the student for not paying attention during the lecture. Here, the student is made sorry for their behavior. \n\nWait, I should make sure the sentences are simple and correct. Let me check the grammar. Both sentences are correct. The first one uses \"felt\" and the second uses \"chastened\" as the verb. Yeah, that's right. So the answer should be those two sentences.\n...done thinking.\n\nchastened; she felt chastened when she realized she had made a mistake in front of the group; chastened; the teacher chastened the student for not paying attention during the lecture"
