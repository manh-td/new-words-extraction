  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"oar\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided the word \"oar\" as a noun and asked for its antonyms. First, I need to recall what antonyms are. Antonyms are words with opposite meanings. So, I need to think of words that mean something opposite to \"oar\".\n\nAn oar is a tool used to row a boat, right? So antonyms would be things that aren't used for rowing. Let's see. Words like \"sail\" come to mind because sailing is the alternative to rowing. Another possibility is \"boat\" but that's the object, not the antonym. \"Row\" is the action, so maybe \"sail\" is better. Wait, but is \"sail\" considered an antonym here? Or is it a related term? Maybe \"sail\" is more of a synonym for \"boat\" in this context. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: \"oar\" is a noun, so the antonym would be something that isn't a boat. But \"sail\" is a noun, so maybe \"sail\" is the antonym. Alternatively, \"boat\" is the object, but \"sail\" is the action. So maybe \"sail\" is the antonym. Are there other words? \"Paddle\" is another word for oar, but that's the same thing. \"Row\" is the action, so maybe \"sail\" is the best antonym. \n\nWait, but the user might expect \"sail\" as the antonym. Let me check. Yes, \"sail\" is the opposite of \"oar\" in the context of boating. So the antonym is \"sail\". Are there any others? Maybe \"boat\" but that's the object. So the answer should be \"sail\". But the user said maximum 2 antonyms. Wait, maybe \"sail\" and \"boat\"? But \"boat\" is the object, not the antonym. So maybe only \"sail\" is the antonym. But the user asked for antonyms, so maybe \"sail\" is the only one. Wait, but maybe \"float\" or \"aerate\"? No, those don't fit. So the answer is \"sail\".\n...done thinking.\n\nsail"
