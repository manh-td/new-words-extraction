  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"diversions\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of \"diversions\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"diversions\" means. It refers to actions or events that are meant to entertain or distract, often in a negative sense, like when someone does something to avoid a problem.\n\nSo, synonyms for \"diversions\" could be words that mean entertainment or distractions. Let me think. \"Amuse\" is a good one because it means to entertain or please. Then there's \"entertain,\" which is more general. But the user specified \"diversions\" as a noun, so maybe \"entertainment\" is a better fit. Wait, \"entertainment\" is a noun and means something provided to amuse people. That's close. Another option could be \"pastime,\" which is also a noun and refers to something done to amuse or occupy time. \n\nI need to check if these are accurate. \"Amuse\" as a verb can be used, but the noun form might be less common. \"Entertainment\" is more straightforward. \"Pastime\" is also a valid synonym. So the best synonyms here would be \"entertainment\" and \"pastime\". Let me confirm if these are commonly used in this context. Yes, both are acceptable. So the answer should list them as synonyms.\n...done thinking.\n\nentertainment; pastime"
