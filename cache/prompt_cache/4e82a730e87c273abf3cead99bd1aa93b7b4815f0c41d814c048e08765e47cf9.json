  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"diversions\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of \"diversions\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"diversions\" means. It refers to things that distract or entertain, like activities that take away attention from something else.\n\nFirst, I need to think of other nouns that mean the same thing. Words like \"entertainments\" come to mind because they're activities that keep people amused. Then there's \"amusements,\" which is similar. Both are nouns and fit the category. Are there any others? Maybe \"pastimes\"? That's another term for activities done for enjoyment. But I should check if \"pastimes\" is considered a synonym here. It's a bit more general, but it can be used in the same context.\n\nWait, the user wants maximum two synonyms. So I can list two. \"Entertainments\" and \"amusements\" are both direct synonyms. \"Pastimes\" is another option, but maybe the user wants more direct synonyms. Let me confirm. \"Entertainments\" is more specific, like events or activities that entertain. \"Amusements\" is broader, including things like games or rides. \"Pastimes\" is a bit more general, like hobbies or leisure activities. \n\nSo the best two synonyms would be \"entertainments\" and \"amusements.\" Alternatively, \"pastimes\" could be included, but maybe the user prefers the more specific terms. To stay within the maximum of two, I'll go with \"entertainments\" and \"amusements.\" \n\nI should check if there are any other common synonyms. \"Leisure activities\" is a bit too broad. \"Distractions\" is the opposite. So no, the best two are the ones I mentioned. Alright, time to format the answer as requested.\n...done thinking.\n\nentertainments; amusements"
