  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"succumbed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants synonyms for \"succumbed\" (verb). First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Succumbed\" means to give in, to be overcome, or to fall under someone else's influence. So synonyms would be words that mean the same thing.\n\nI remember that \"yielded\" is a common synonym. It means to give in or surrender. Then there's \"submitted,\" which means to give in to someone's will. Both of these fit the meaning of succumbing. Let me check if there are others. \"Caved in\" is another possibility, but that's more about collapsing, not necessarily giving in. \"Lapsed\" might be too formal. \"Given in\" is a bit colloquial. So the best synonyms are yielded and submitted. I should present them as a single string separated by semicolons. Make sure not to include any other words. Alright, that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nyielded; submitted"
