  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"succumbed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants synonyms for \"succumbed\" (verb). Let me think. First, I need to recall the meaning of the word. \"Succumbed\" means to give in, to be overcome, or to submit. So synonyms would be words that mean the same thing.\n\nPossible synonyms could be \"yielded,\" \"submitted,\" \"gave in,\" \"cracked,\" \"bowled,\" \"submitted,\" \"submitted,\" \"yielded.\" Wait, but the user wants maximum two synonyms. Let me check which are most common. \"Yielded\" and \"submitted\" are both common. \"Gave in\" is a bit more informal. \"Cracked\" might be less common. So the best two would be \"yielded\" and \"submitted.\" Let me make sure there's no other common ones. \"Bowled\" is archaic. So yeah, the answer should be \"yielded; submitted.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nyielded; submitted"
