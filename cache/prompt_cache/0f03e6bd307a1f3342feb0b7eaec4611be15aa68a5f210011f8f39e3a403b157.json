  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"institutions\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"institutions\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to recall what the word \"institutions\" means. It refers to organized groups or bodies, like schools, governments, or organizations.\n\nNow, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. So, what are the opposite terms for institutions? Maybe something like \"individuals\" because institutions are groups, so individuals are the opposite in that sense. Another antonym could be \"disruptions\" but that's more about the effect rather than the opposite of the noun. Wait, \"disruptions\" is an adjective, so maybe not. \n\nAnother thought: \"institutions\" can also mean formal organizations, so antonyms might be \"individuals\" or \"personalities\". But the user specified \"antonyms\" for the noun, so \"individuals\" is a better fit. Are there others? \"Organizations\" is a synonym, not an antonym. \"Groups\" is a synonym too. \n\nSo the main antonyms here are \"individuals\" and \"personalities\". But wait, \"personalities\" is more about people's traits, while \"individuals\" is about people as entities. Both could work. But the user wants maximum 2, so maybe \"individuals; personalities\". However, I need to check if \"personalities\" is an antonym. Maybe \"individuals\" is more accurate. \n\nAlternatively, \"institutions\" can also be contrasted with \"individuals\" and \"personalities\". But maybe \"individuals\" is the primary antonym. Let me confirm. Yes, \"institutions\" as a noun refers to organized groups, so \"individuals\" is the opposite. Another possible antonym is \"personalities\", but that's more about the characteristics. So the best antonyms are \"individuals\" and \"personalities\". But the user might expect \"individuals\" as the main one. \n\nWait, the user said \"antonyms (maximum 2)\". So I can list two. So the answer would be \"individuals; personalities\". But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe \"individuals\" is the only correct antonym. Hmm. \n\nI think the most accurate antonyms are \"individuals\" and \"personalities\". So the answer is \"individuals; personalities\".\n...done thinking.\n\nindividuals; personalities"
