  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"institutions\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"institutions\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"institutions\" means. It refers to organized groups or systems, like schools, governments, or organizations.\n\nSo, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. Common antonyms for institutions might be things like \"disruptions,\" \"chaos,\" or \"disorder.\" But wait, the user wants antonyms for \"institutions\" as a noun. So, maybe \"disruptions\" is a good one because it's the opposite of organized systems. Another possible antonym could be \"disorder,\" but that's more about the state rather than the noun itself. \n\nWait, \"institutions\" can also refer to things like \"institutions of higher learning,\" so antonyms might be \"disruptions\" or \"chaos.\" But I need to make sure. Let me think again. If the word is \"institutions\" as a noun, the antonyms would be things that are not organized systems. So \"disruptions\" makes sense because it's the opposite of organized structures. \"Chaos\" is more about disorder, but maybe not exactly the opposite in this context. \n\nAlternatively, \"degradation\" could be an antonym, but that's less common. The most direct antonyms here are likely \"disruptions\" and \"chaos.\" But I need to check if \"chaos\" is considered an antonym. Maybe \"disruptions\" is better. Let me confirm. \n\nYes, \"disruptions\" is the antonym because it's the opposite of institutions. \"Chaos\" is more about disorder, but maybe not the exact antonym. So the answer should be \"disruptions; chaos.\" But wait, the user asked for maximum 2 antonyms. So I should list them as such.\n...done thinking.\n\ndisruptions; chaos"
