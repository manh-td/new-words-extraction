  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"chastened\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to provide two example sentences using the word \"chastened\" as a verb. Let me think about how to use it correctly.\n\nFirst, \"chastened\" means to make someone feel ashamed or embarrassed. So, the sentences should show someone feeling ashamed. Maybe something like a student who got caught cheating. Then, another example could be a person who was embarrassed by their own actions. Wait, but the word is a verb, so the sentences need to be verb forms. Let me check the correct usage.\n\n\"Chastened\" is past tense of \"chasten,\" so the sentences should use the past tense. For example, \"She was chastened by the public's reaction.\" Or \"He chastened himself after the mistake.\" Wait, but the user asked for the word as a verb, so maybe the sentences should use the past tense. Let me make sure. \n\nYes, the word is a verb, so the sentences should be in the past tense. So, \"The athlete was chastened by the referee's decision.\" And \"The child was chastened by the teacher's criticism.\" That should work. Let me check if these sentences are correct and make sense. Yes, they use the past tense and show the result of being chastened. Alright, that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nshe was chastened by the public's reaction; he chastened himself after the mistake"
