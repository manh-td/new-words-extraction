  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"chastened\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"chastened\" which is an adjective. Let me think about what \"chastened\" means. Chastened means feeling ashamed or embarrassed, right? So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite, like not feeling ashamed or embarrassed.\n\nHmm, what are the opposite words for chastened? Maybe \"unembarrassed\" comes to mind. That's a direct antonym. Then there's \"unshamed\" which also means not ashamed. Wait, but the user wants the maximum of two antonyms. Are there any others? Maybe \"unafraid\" but that's more about fear than shame. Or \"confident\"? No, that's not exactly opposite. \n\nSo the two strongest antonyms are \"unembarrassed\" and \"unshamed\". I should check if those are correct. Yes, \"unembarrassed\" means not feeling embarrassed, and \"unshamed\" means not feeling ashamed. Both are valid antonyms. So the answer should be those two joined by a semicolon.\n...done thinking.\n\nunembarrassed; unshamed"
