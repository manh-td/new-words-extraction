  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"eminently\"(adverb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"eminently\" (an adverb). First, I need to recall what \"eminently\" means. It's an adverb meaning \"in a way that is especially good or excellent.\" So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite, like not being excellent or not in a way that's especially good.\n\nPossible antonyms could be \"incompetently\" (which is an adverb meaning poorly) or \"barely\" (an adverb meaning scarcely). Wait, but \"barely\" is more about not enough, while \"incompetently\" is about being bad. Both could work. Are there others? Maybe \"negatively\" but that's an adjective. So the best antonyms are \"incompetently\" and \"barely\". Let me check if those are correct. Yes, \"incompetently\" is the antonym of \"eminently\" in the sense of being poor, and \"barely\" is the opposite in terms of quantity. So the answer should be those two joined by a semicolon.\n...done thinking.\n\nincompetently;barely"
