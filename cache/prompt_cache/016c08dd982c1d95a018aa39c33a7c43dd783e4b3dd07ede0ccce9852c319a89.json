  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"eroded\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for the antonyms of \"eroded\" (verb). Let me think. First, I need to recall what the opposite of \"eroded\" means. \"Erode\" means to wear away or dissolve, usually by physical or chemical means. So antonyms would be things that don't wear away or dissolve.\n\nPossible antonyms could be \"build\" or \"strengthen\". \"Build\" means to construct or accumulate, which could counteract erosion. \"Strengthen\" would mean to make something more robust, which might also be an antonym in a metaphorical sense. But I need to check if these are accurate.\n\nAnother possibility is \"conserve\" or \"preserve\", but those are more about keeping something intact. \"Conserve\" is a bit more about maintaining, so maybe that's a good one. However, the user asked for verb antonyms, so \"conserve\" is a verb. \n\nWait, \"conserve\" as a verb means to keep something from being lost, which could be an antonym. But I need to make sure. Let me verify. \"Erode\" and \"conserve\" are opposites in a sense. Similarly, \"build\" and \"strengthen\" are also opposites. \n\nSo the possible antonyms are \"build\", \"strengthen\", \"conserve\". But the user wants maximum two. So I need to pick the most appropriate two. \"Build\" and \"strengthen\" are both verbs. \"Conserve\" is also a verb. But maybe the user expects the most direct antonyms. \n\nAlternatively, \"rebuild\" or \"repair\" could be antonyms, but those are more about fixing. \"Rebuild\" is a bit more specific. \n\nHmm. The most common antonyms for \"erode\" would be \"build\" and \"strengthen\". \"Conserve\" is also a good one, but maybe the user wants the most straightforward answers. Let me check a dictionary. \n\nLooking up antonyms for \"erode\": \"build\", \"strengthen\", \"conserve\", \"repair\", \"rebuild\". So the top ones are \"build\", \"strengthen\", \"conserve\". But the user asked for maximum two. So the answer would be \"build; strengthen; conserve\". But the user said maximum 2, so maybe pick the top two. \n\nWait, the user said \"antonyms (maximum 2)\". So if there are three, pick two. So the answer would be \"build; strengthen\" or \"build; conserve\". Which is better? \"Build\" is more directly opposite to erosion, while \"conserve\" is more about maintaining. \n\nI think the best answer is \"build; strengthen\". So the final answer is \"build; strengthen\".\n...done thinking.\n\nbuild; strengthen"
