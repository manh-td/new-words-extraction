  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"eroded\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for the antonyms of \"eroded\" and I need to provide them. Let me start by recalling what \"eroded\" means. It's a verb that means to wear away or dissolve over time, often due to natural processes like water or wind.\n\nSo, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of wearing away. Think of words that could reverse the process. The most obvious ones come to mind: \"built\" or \"constructed\" because they involve putting something together. But wait, \"built\" is more about creating, while \"constructed\" is more about building. Maybe \"repaired\" or \"restored\"? Those are about fixing something that's been damaged.\n\nAnother possibility is \"strengthened\" or \"fortified,\" but those are more about making something stronger, which is the opposite of eroding. However, \"strengthened\" is more about increasing strength, while \"fortified\" is about adding walls or defenses. Both could work.\n\nSo, the antonyms would be \"built,\" \"constructed,\" \"repaired,\" \"restored,\" \"strengthened,\" \"fortified.\" But the user wants maximum two antonyms. Let me check which ones are most accurate. \"Built\" and \"constructed\" are direct opposites of eroding. \"Repaired\" and \"restored\" are also opposites, but maybe \"strengthened\" and \"fortified\" are less direct. \n\nThe user might expect the most straightforward antonyms. So, \"built\" and \"constructed\" are the best choices. But wait, \"built\" is more about creating, while \"constructed\" is about building. Both are valid. So the answer should be \"built; constructed\".\n...done thinking.\n\nbuilt; constructed"
