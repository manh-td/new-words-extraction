  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"groomed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of the word \"groomed\" as a verb. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"groomed\" means. It's a verb that means to prepare or to take care of someone, often in a romantic context, like preparing a bride for her wedding.\n\nSo, the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of preparing or taking care of. Let me think. Words like \"undone\" come to mind, but that's more about reversing an action. Maybe \"unprepared\"? Wait, \"unprepared\" is an adjective. The antonym of \"prepared\" would be \"unprepared,\" but the question is about the verb \"groomed.\" So, the antonym of \"groomed\" as a verb would be something that means to not prepare or to leave someone unprepared.\n\nAnother possibility is \"unraveled,\" but that's more about unraveling something. Maybe \"unraveled\" isn't the right fit here. Let me think again. The opposite of \"groomed\" as a verb might be \"left unprepared\" or \"not prepared.\" But the user wants antonyms, so maybe \"unprepared\" is the antonym. But \"unprepared\" is an adjective. The verb form would be \"unprepare,\" but that's not a standard word. \n\nWait, maybe \"unraveled\" isn't the right answer. Let me check. The antonym of \"groomed\" as a verb could be \"unprepared\" or \"left unprepared.\" But since the user is asking for antonyms, maybe \"unprepared\" is the main one. Alternatively, \"unraveled\" might not fit. \n\nAnother angle: \"groomed\" means to prepare, so the antonym would be something that means to not prepare. \"Unprepared\" is the antonym of \"prepared,\" so \"unprepared\" would be the antonym. But the user might be looking for a different word. Maybe \"unraveled\" isn't the right answer here. \n\nAlternatively, \"unraveled\" could be a metaphorical sense, but in the context of preparing, maybe \"unprepared\" is the correct antonym. So, the answer would be \"unprepared.\" But the user asked for maximum two antonyms. If there's another one, like \"unraveled,\" but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe \"unraveled\" is not the right antonym. Let me think again. The verb \"groomed\" is to prepare, so the antonym would be to not prepare, which is \"unprepared.\" But \"unprepared\" is an adjective. So, the antonym of \"groomed\" as a verb would be \"unprepared.\" But the user might want the antonym as a verb. However, \"unprepared\" is an adjective. So, maybe the answer is \"unprepared.\" But the user might expect another word. \n\nAlternatively, \"unraveled\" is not the right antonym. So, the only antonym is \"unprepared.\" But the user asked for maximum two. Maybe there's another one. Let me think. \"Unraveled\" is not the opposite. \"Unraveled\" could mean to undo, but that's different. \n\nSo, the antonym of \"groomed\" as a verb is \"unprepared.\" Therefore, the answer is \"unprepared.\" But the user wants antonyms, so maybe \"unprepared\" is the only one. But the user said maximum two. Maybe there's another one. Wait, \"unraveled\" is not the opposite. So, the answer is only \"unprepared.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nunprepared"
