  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"groomed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for the antonyms of the word \"groomed\" as a verb. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"groomed\" means. It's a verb that means to prepare or train someone for a role, like training a horse or preparing a candidate for a job. So the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of preparing or training.\n\nWhat are the opposite actions? Maybe \"untrained\" or \"unprepared\"? But wait, \"untrained\" is more about not having been trained, while \"unprepared\" is about not being ready. Both could work. Are there other possible antonyms? Maybe \"untrained\" is more commonly used in this context. Let me check. Yes, \"untrained\" is an antonym. Another one could be \"unprepared\", but maybe \"untrained\" is more precise here. So the answer should be \"untrained; unprepared\" or something like that. Wait, the user said maximum 2, so two antonyms. Let me confirm again. \"Groomed\" means to prepare, so antonyms would be things that don't prepare. So \"untrained\" and \"unprepared\" are both correct. But maybe \"untrained\" is more directly the antonym. Alternatively, \"untrained\" and \"unprepared\" are both valid. But since the user wants maximum two, I can list both. So the final answer is \"untrained; unprepared\".\n...done thinking.\n\nuntrained; unprepared"
