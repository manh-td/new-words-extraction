  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"uncanny\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"uncanny\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"uncanny\" means. It usually refers to something that is strange, eerie, or supernatural, often to the point of being unsettling.\n\nSo, antonyms would be words that contrast with \"uncanny.\" Words like \"ordinary\" or \"normal\" come to mind because they are the opposite of strange or eerie. Another possible antonym could be \"familiar,\" but I need to make sure that's accurate. Wait, \"familiar\" is more about being known or common, which might not exactly fit. \n\nAnother thought: \"common\" could be an antonym, but \"ordinary\" is more precise. Let me check if \"ordinary\" is considered an antonym here. Yes, \"ordinary\" means typical or common, which opposes \"uncanny\" in the sense of being strange. \n\nSo the two antonyms would be \"ordinary\" and \"familiar.\" But wait, \"familiar\" is more about being known, while \"ordinary\" is about being common. Which one is more appropriate here? Maybe \"ordinary\" is better. Alternatively, \"normal\" could work, but \"ordinary\" is more commonly used in this context. \n\nI think the correct antonyms are \"ordinary\" and \"familiar.\" But I need to confirm. Let me think again. \"Uncanny\" is often used to describe something that is strange or eerie. So the antonyms would be things that are not strange or not eerie. \"Ordinary\" fits because it's the opposite of strange. \"Familiar\" is about being known, which might not be the same as being strange. \n\nSo maybe \"ordinary\" is the better choice. But the user asked for antonyms, so if there are multiple, I should list them. However, the user specified maximum 2, so maybe \"ordinary\" and \"normal\" are both valid. But \"normal\" is more about being typical, while \"ordinary\" is about being common. \n\nI think the most accurate antonyms here are \"ordinary\" and \"familiar.\" But I need to check if \"familiar\" is indeed an antonym. \"Familiar\" can mean something that is known or accustomed, which might not be the same as being strange. So maybe \"ordinary\" is the better answer. \n\nAlternatively, \"common\" could be an antonym, but \"ordinary\" is more precise. So the answer should be \"ordinary; familiar.\" But I need to make sure. Let me verify. \n\nYes, \"ordinary\" is an antonym, and \"familiar\" can be considered an antonym in some contexts. So the final answer would be \"ordinary; familiar.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nordinary; familiar"
