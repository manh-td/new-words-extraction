  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"uncanny\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"uncanny\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to recall what the antonyms are. \"Uncanny\" means surprising or strange in a way that's unsettling. So antonyms would be things that are not strange or surprising.\n\nPossible antonyms could be \"ordinary\" or \"common\". \"Ordinary\" means typical or usual, which contrasts with \"uncanny\" because it's not strange. \"Common\" also means usual, but maybe \"ordinary\" is more direct. Are there other options? \"Normal\" might work too, but \"ordinary\" is more commonly used as an antonym for \"uncanny\" in this context. Let me check if these are correct. Yes, \"ordinary\" and \"common\" are both antonyms. So the answer should be \"ordinary; common\".\n...done thinking.\n\nordinary; common"
