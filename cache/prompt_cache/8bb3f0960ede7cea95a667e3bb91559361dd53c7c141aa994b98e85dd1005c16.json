  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"geodesic\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of \"geodesic\" as a noun. Let me think. Geodesic usually refers to a path that measures the shortest distance between two points on a surface, like the Earth. So synonyms could be things like \"shortest path\" or \"optimal route.\" But I need to make sure they're nouns. \"Optimal route\" is a noun. \"Shortest path\" is also a noun. Are there any other common synonyms? Maybe \"geodesic line\"? But that's more specific. The user wants maximum two, so I'll go with \"shortest path; optimal route.\" Let me check if those are accurate. Yes, geodesic is indeed the shortest path on a curved surface, and optimal route is a general term. So that's the answer.\n...done thinking.\n\nshortest path; optimal route"
