  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"geodesic\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of \"geodesic\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what geodesic means. From what I remember, a geodesic is a path that measures the shortest distance between two points on a surface, like a sphere. So, synonyms would be words that mean the same thing.\n\nFirst, I should think of other terms that describe a path that's the shortest. Words like \"straight line\" come to mind, but that's more about the physical path. Then there's \"geodesic\" itself, so maybe \"geodesic\" is considered a synonym here. But the user wants synonyms, so I need to find other words.\n\nAnother term that comes to mind is \"great circle.\" A great circle is a circle drawn on a sphere that has the same center as the sphere. The shortest path on a sphere is a great circle, so that's a synonym. Then there's \"minimal path,\" but that's more general. \n\nWait, \"geodesic\" is specifically a path on a surface, so \"great circle\" is a specific type of geodesic. So maybe \"great circle\" is a synonym. Are there others? \"Straight line\" might be a synonym, but I'm not sure if that's considered a direct synonym. \n\nAlternatively, \"shortest path\" could work, but that's more of a definition. The user asked for synonyms, so \"great circle\" and \"straight line\" might be the best options. Let me check if \"straight line\" is considered a synonym here. In geometry, a straight line is the shortest path between two points, so that's accurate. \n\nSo the two synonyms would be \"great circle\" and \"straight line.\" But I need to make sure they are correct. Another possible synonym is \"minimal path,\" but that's more of a general term. \n\nSo the final answer should be \"great circle; straight line.\"\n...done thinking.\n\ngreat circle; straight line"
