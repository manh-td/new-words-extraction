  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"menial\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to create two example sentences using the word \"menial\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. A menial is someone who does menial tasks, like cleaning or preparing food. So, the sentences should reflect that.\n\nMaybe start with a sentence where someone is a menial. Like, \"The menial cleaned the floor every morning.\" That's straightforward. Then another one where the menial is doing a specific task. \"The menial carefully arranged the books on the shelf.\" That shows the kind of work they do. I should check if the word is used as a noun here, which it is. Also, make sure the sentences are simple and fit the format. No JSON, just the two sentences separated by semicolons. Alright, that should work.\n...done thinking.\n\nmenial; the menial cleaned the floor every morning; the menial carefully arranged the books on the shelf"
