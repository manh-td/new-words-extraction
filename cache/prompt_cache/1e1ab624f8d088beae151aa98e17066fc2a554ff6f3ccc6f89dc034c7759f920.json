  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"menial\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences using the word \"menial\" as a noun. Let me think. A menial is someone who does menial tasks, right? So first sentence could be something like \"The menial helped clean the office.\" Then another one maybe \"The company hired a menial to handle administrative tasks.\" Wait, but \"menial\" is more like a servant or a helper, so maybe \"menial\" is used in a more formal context. Let me check if \"menial\" is indeed a noun. Yes, it's a noun meaning a servant or a person who does menial work. So the sentences should reflect that. The first example is correct. The second one could be \"The menial was tasked with organizing the event.\" But maybe \"menial\" is more commonly used in the sense of a servant. Alternatively, \"The menial worked in the kitchen.\" Hmm, but the user asked for maximum two sentences. Let me make sure both sentences are accurate. The first one is good, the second one is also correct. I think that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nmenial helped clean the office; the menial was tasked with organizing the event"
