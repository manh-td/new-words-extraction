  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bohemian\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the word \"bohemian\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. A bohemian is someone who lives a free-spirited, non-conformist life, often associated with art, music, or literature.\n\nSo, possible sentences could involve someone who is creative or lives a nomadic life. Maybe something like a painter or a poet. Let me check if the examples are accurate. \n\nFirst sentence: \"The bohemian artist painted vivid landscapes, capturing the essence of nature.\" That works. Second sentence: \"She moved from city to city, embracing the bohemian lifestyle, where she lived off the grid and pursued her passion for music.\" That also makes sense. \n\nI need to make sure the sentences are concise and use the word as a noun. Also, the user specified maximum two sentences, so I should stick to that. Let me double-check the grammar and vocabulary. Yep, looks good. No JSON, just the sentences in the required format.\n...done thinking.\n\nbohemian artist painted vivid landscapes, capturing the essence of nature; she moved from city to city, embracing the bohemian lifestyle, where she lived off the grid and pursued her passion for music."
