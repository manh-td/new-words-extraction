  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"commodity\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for antonyms of the word \"commodity\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to recall what a commodity is. Commodity is a raw material or a product that is interchangeable, like grain or oil. So antonyms would be things that are not interchangeable or not raw materials.\n\nPossible antonyms could be \"luxury\" because commodities are usually considered basic, but that's a bit of a stretch. Wait, maybe \"non-commodity\" but that's too vague. Another thought: \"specie\" which is money, but that's not exactly an antonym. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user wants antonyms for \"commodity\" as a noun. So maybe \"non-commodity\" but that's not a standard term. Let me think of more accurate antonyms. \"Commodity\" is something that can be bought and sold, so antonyms might be \"barbarian\" or \"primitive\"? No, that's not right. \n\nWait, maybe \"non-commodity\" is too broad. Let me check. In economics, a commodity is a raw material, so antonyms could be \"luxury\" or \"speciality\". But I need to make sure these are accurate. \"Luxury\" is a type of commodity? Not exactly. Maybe \"non-commodity\" is the best, but the user might expect specific words. \n\nAlternatively, \"commodity\" and \"non-commodity\" are opposites, but the user wants antonyms. So maybe \"non-commodity\" is the answer. But the user asked for antonyms, so perhaps \"non-commodity\" is the only valid one. But the system says maximum 2. Maybe \"non-commodity\" and \"specie\" (money)? But specie is a type of commodity. \n\nWait, maybe \"non-commodity\" is the main antonym, and \"specie\" is another. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, \"non-commodity\" is the primary antonym, and \"luxury\" is another. But I need to verify. \n\nAlternatively, \"commodity\" and \"non-commodity\" are the direct antonyms. So the answer would be \"non-commodity\". But the user might expect more. Maybe \"non-commodity\" and \"specie\" but I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the constraints, the best antonyms are \"non-commodity\" and \"specie\" (though specie is a type of commodity). But maybe the user expects \"non-commodity\" as the only valid antonym. However, the system allows up to two. So perhaps \"non-commodity; specie\". But I need to check if \"specie\" is an antonym. \n\nAlternatively, \"non-commodity\" is the main antonym, and \"luxury\" is another. But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct antonyms are \"non-commodity\" and \"specie\". But I need to make sure. \n\nIn conclusion, the antonyms are \"non-commodity\" and \"specie\", but I'm not entirely certain. However, the user might expect \"non-commodity\" as the primary answer. But since the system allows two, I'll go with \"non-commodity; specie\".\n...done thinking.\n\nnon-commodity; specie"
