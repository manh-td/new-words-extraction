  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"commodity\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for antonyms of the word \"commodity\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what a commodity is. From what I know, a commodity is a raw material or a product that is interchangeable, like wheat or steel. So, antonyms would be things that are not interchangeable or are more specific.\n\nHmm, the word \"commodity\" is a noun. Antonyms would be words that are opposites. Let me think. Words like \"unique\" or \"specific\" come to mind. But wait, are those considered antonyms here? Or maybe \"speciality\"? Wait, \"speciality\" is not a standard English word. Maybe \"unique\" is better. Another thought: \"material\" is a synonym, so its antonym would be \"non-material\" or \"abstract\". But the user wants antonyms for \"commodity\", so maybe \"unique\" or \"specific\" are better. Let me check if those are standard. \n\nWait, \"commodity\" is a noun, so antonyms would be nouns. So \"unique\" is an adjective, so maybe \"uncommodity\" isn't a standard word. Maybe \"specific\" is better. Alternatively, \"raw material\" is a synonym, so the antonym would be \"processed material\" or \"manufactured product\". But the user wants antonyms for \"commodity\" as a noun. So maybe \"unique\" or \"specific\" are the antonyms. Let me confirm. \n\nAnother angle: commodities are things that can be bought and sold, so antonyms might be things that are not traded, like \"goods\" but that's not exactly an antonym. Maybe \"goods\" is a synonym. So the antonyms would be \"unique\" or \"specific\". I think the correct antonyms here are \"unique\" and \"specific\". So joining them with semicolons. Let me make sure there are only two. Yes, that's it. So the answer should be \"unique; specific\".\n...done thinking.\n\nunique; specific"
