  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"innate\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"innate\" (adjective). Let me think. Innate means something that is inherent or present from birth. So synonyms could be words like inherent or natural. Wait, are those correct? Inherent is a good synonym. Natural also fits because it's something that happens naturally, like innate traits. But I need to check if \"natural\" is considered an adjective here. Yeah, it can be. So the two synonyms would be inherent and natural. Let me make sure there's no other common synonyms. Maybe \"genetic\" but that's more about inherited traits. So the best ones are inherent and natural. I should present them as a single string separated by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\ninherent;natural"
