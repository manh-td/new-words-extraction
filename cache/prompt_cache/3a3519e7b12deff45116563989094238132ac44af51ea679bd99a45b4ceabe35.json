  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"innate\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"innate\" (adjective). Let me think. \"Innate\" means something present at birth or something that is inherent. Synonyms could be \"natural\" or \"hereditary\". Wait, \"hereditary\" is more about passing down traits, but \"natural\" fits better. \"Innate\" can also be \"essential\" or \"original\", but \"essential\" is more about being necessary. Let me check the most common synonyms. \"Natural\" and \"hereditary\" are both valid. But sometimes \"inherent\" is used, but that's a different form. The user wants adjectives, so \"inherent\" would be correct. But maybe the top choices are \"natural\" and \"hereditary\". Let me confirm. Yes, \"natural\" and \"hereditary\" are standard synonyms for \"innate\". So the answer should be those two, joined by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\nnatural; hereditary"
