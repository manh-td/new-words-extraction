  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"fostering\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants synonyms for the word \"fostering\" as a verb. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Fostering\" means to encourage or promote the growth of something, like a plant or a idea.\n\nSo, synonyms would be words that mean the same thing. Let me think. \"Sowing\" comes to mind because planting something (like seeds) is similar to fostering growth. Another one might be \"cultivating,\" which is about growing something carefully. Are there any others? \"Promoting\" is a synonym, but that's more of a general term. Wait, the user specified \"verb,\" so \"sowing\" and \"cultivating\" are both verbs. Let me check if those are accurate. Yes, both are verbs and mean to encourage growth. I think that's it. So the answer should be those two, joined by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\nsowing;cultivating"
