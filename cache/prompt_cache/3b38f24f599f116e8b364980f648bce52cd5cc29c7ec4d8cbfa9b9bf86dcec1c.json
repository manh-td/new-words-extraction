  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"fostering\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants synonyms for the word \"fostering\" as a verb. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Fostering\" means to encourage or promote the growth of something, like a plant or a person.\n\nSo, synonyms could be words that mean to nurture or to promote. Let me think. \"Nurturing\" is a good one because it directly relates to caring for something. Then there's \"promoting,\" which also means to encourage the growth of something. \n\nWait, are there any other common synonyms? Maybe \"cultivating\"? That's another way to grow something. But I need to check if \"cultivating\" is considered a synonym here. It does mean to grow something, so it could work. But the user asked for maximum two, so maybe \"nurturing\" and \"promoting\" are the top ones.\n\nLet me verify. \"Fostering\" can also be synonyms like \"sowing\" or \"sowing seeds,\" but those are more specific. \"Sowing\" is more about planting, while \"fostering\" is about encouraging growth. So maybe \"nurturing\" and \"promoting\" are better. \n\nI should check if \"cultivating\" is acceptable. Some might consider it a synonym, but it's a bit more specific. The user might prefer more general terms. So sticking with \"nurturing\" and \"promoting\" seems better. \n\nSo the answer should be those two, joined by semicolons. Let me make sure there's no mistake. Yes, those are correct synonyms.\n...done thinking.\n\nnurturing; promoting"
