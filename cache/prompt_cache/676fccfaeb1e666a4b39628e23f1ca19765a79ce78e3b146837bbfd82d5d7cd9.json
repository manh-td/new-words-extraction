  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"niche\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"niche\" as a verb. Let me start by recalling what the verb \"niche\" means. From what I know, \"niche\" as a verb means to create a niche or to dig into something, like creating a small cavity or a space. \n\nNow, antonyms are words that have the opposite meaning. So, I need to think of words that mean the opposite of creating a niche. Let's see... The opposite of creating a space or a cavity could be something like \"fill\" or \"occupy.\" Wait, \"fill\" might be more about filling a space, but does that exactly oppose creating a niche? Maybe. Another possibility is \"erect,\" but that's more about building something. \n\nAlternatively, \"burrow\" is a verb meaning to dig underground, which is similar to niching but maybe not exactly opposite. Hmm. Let me think again. If \"niche\" is about creating a small space, then the antonym would be something that removes or takes away space. Words like \"remove,\" \"eliminate,\" or \"remove\" could work. But the user wants antonyms, so maybe \"fill\" or \"occupy\" are better. \n\nWait, \"fill\" is more about filling a space, but if you fill a niche, you're filling it. So the opposite might be \"empty\" or \"remove.\" But \"remove\" is a bit more general. Let me check if there are standard antonyms. In some contexts, \"niche\" could also mean to create a small cavity, so the antonym might be \"fill\" or \"occupy.\" But \"fill\" is more about filling, while \"occupy\" is about taking up space. \n\nI think the best antonyms here are \"fill\" and \"remove.\" But I need to make sure. Another angle: if \"niche\" is to create a niche, the opposite could be \"erect\" (to build), but that's not exactly opposite. Maybe \"remove\" is better. \n\nAlternatively, \"burrow\" is a verb that means to dig, but that's similar. So perhaps the main antonyms are \"fill\" and \"remove.\" But I need to check if these are accurate. \n\nWait, \"fill\" is the direct antonym in some contexts. For example, if you \"fill a niche,\" the opposite would be \"remove the niche.\" But \"remove\" is more about taking away. So maybe \"remove\" is better. \n\nSo the antonyms would be \"fill\" and \"remove.\" But I need to confirm if these are correct. Alternatively, \"erect\" is another possibility, but that's more about building. \n\nI think the most accurate antonyms are \"fill\" and \"remove.\" So the answer should be \"fill; remove.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nfill; remove"
