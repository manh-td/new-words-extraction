  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"niche\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of the word \"niche\" as a verb. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"niche\" means as a verb. From what I recall, \"niche\" can mean to create a space or a place for something, or to make a niche in a particular area. So, the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of creating a space or a niche.\n\nThinking about antonyms, \"niche\" as a verb could relate to something like \"fill\" or \"occupy,\" but I need to be precise. Let me think of synonyms first to confirm. Synonyms for \"niche\" as a verb might be \"create,\" \"make,\" \"establish,\" or \"set apart.\" So antonyms would be words that mean to remove, take away, or leave empty.\n\nPossible antonyms could be \"empty,\" \"remove,\" \"take,\" or \"leave.\" But I need to check if these are accurate. For example, \"empty\" would be the opposite of \"create a niche,\" but \"remove\" might be more about taking away something. \"Take\" is also a possible antonym, but maybe \"leave\" is more about leaving behind. \n\nWait, the user asked for antonyms, so I need to pick the most accurate ones. \"Empty\" is a direct antonym because if you empty a niche, you remove the content. \"Remove\" is also a good one. \"Leave\" might not be the best because leaving a niche doesn't necessarily mean the opposite. \"Take\" could be a synonym for \"create,\" but \"take\" as a verb can mean to remove. \n\nSo the most accurate antonyms would be \"empty\" and \"remove.\" But I need to check if these are commonly used. Alternatively, \"vacant\" might be an antonym, but that's more about being empty. However, the user might expect simpler words. \n\nSo the answer should be \"empty; remove\" or \"empty; take.\" But I think \"empty\" and \"remove\" are better. Let me confirm. If you \"niche\" something, you're creating a space. The antonyms would be words that mean to take away or leave empty. So yes, \"empty\" and \"remove\" are correct. Therefore, the answer is \"empty; remove\".\n...done thinking.\n\nempty; remove"
