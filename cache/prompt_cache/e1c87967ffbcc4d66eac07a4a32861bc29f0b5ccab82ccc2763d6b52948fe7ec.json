  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"apparent\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the word \"apparent\" as an adjective. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I use the correct form. \"Apparent\" means something that is obvious or visible, or something that is not hidden.\n\nMaybe start with a sentence about something that is obvious. Like, \"The weather was apparent from the clouds.\" Wait, that sounds a bit off. Maybe \"The weather was apparent in the clouds.\" Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, \"The fact was apparent to everyone.\" That works. \n\nAnother sentence could be about something that is not hidden. Like, \"The treasure was hidden, but its presence was apparent to the explorers.\" That uses \"apparent\" correctly. Or maybe \"The signs were apparent, indicating the path to the village.\" \n\nWait, the user wants maximum two sentences. Let me check if these examples are correct. The first one: \"The fact was apparent to everyone.\" That's good. The second: \"The signs were apparent, indicating the path to the village.\" That's also good. I think those are valid examples. Let me make sure they're in the right format and don't have any errors.\n...done thinking.\n\napparent; the weather was apparent in the clouds; the signs were apparent, indicating the path to the village"
