  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"apparent\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the word \"apparent\" as an adjective. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I use the correct form. \"Apparent\" means something that is evident or obvious. So maybe something like \"The weather was apparent that it was going to rain.\" Wait, that sounds a bit off. Maybe \"The signs were apparent that the storm was approaching.\" That works. Another sentence could be \"Her smile was apparent to everyone, even those who didn't know her.\" That uses it in a different context. Let me check if those sentences are correct. Yes, they make sense. I should present them in the required format.\n...done thinking.\n\nThe weather was apparent that it was going to rain; Her smile was apparent to everyone, even those who didn't know her."
