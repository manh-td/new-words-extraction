  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"secularized\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the word \"secularized\" as a verb. Let me think about how to use it correctly.\n\nFirst, \"secularized\" means to make something secular, removing religious elements. So sentences should show the process of making something secular. Maybe something like a church becoming secular. \n\nAnother example could be a society becoming secular. That shows the transformation. I need to make sure the sentences are correct and use the word in the right context. Let me check the tense and subject-verb agreement. \n\nSentence 1: The church was secularized when the pastor left. Here, \"was secularized\" is past tense, which is correct because the action is completed. \n\nSentence 2: The country's education system was secularized to promote equality. This uses the present perfect tense, which is appropriate for a completed action that has ongoing effects. \n\nI think that's good. They are both valid and use the word correctly. No need for any extra explanations or formatting. Just the two sentences as requested.\n...done thinking.\n\nthe church was secularized when the pastor left; the country's education system was secularized to promote equality"
