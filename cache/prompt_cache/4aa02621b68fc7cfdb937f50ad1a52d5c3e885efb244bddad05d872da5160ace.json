  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"secularized\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences for the verb \"secularized\". Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Secularized\" means to make something secular, removing religious elements. So, the sentences should show that.\n\nMaybe start with something like \"The church was secularized after the war.\" That shows the process of removing religious aspects. Then another example: \"The school district secularized its curriculum to focus on science.\" That shows it in a educational context. Wait, but the user asked for maximum two sentences. Let me check if those are appropriate. Yes, they both use the verb correctly. I should format them as specified, no JSON or explanation. So the answer would be those two sentences.\n...done thinking.\n\nthe church was secularized after the war; the school district secularized its curriculum to focus on science"
