  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"assailed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for the antonyms of \"assailed\" (verb). Let me think. First, I need to recall what the antonyms are. \"Assailed\" means to attack or strike with force. So the opposite would be something like \"defeated\" or \"overcome\". Wait, but \"defeated\" is more about being conquered, while \"overcome\" is about succeeding. Maybe \"overcome\" is closer. Another option could be \"rescued\" but that's more about saving. \"Rebuked\" is to criticize, which isn't exactly the opposite. \"Unscathed\" means not harmed, but that's more about being untouched. So the best antonyms are \"overcome\" and \"rescued\". But wait, \"rescued\" might not be the most accurate. Let me check again. \"Assailed\" is to attack, so the antonyms would be things that don't attack. \"Overcome\" is to defeat, \"restrain\" is to prevent, but \"restrain\" isn't a direct antonym. Hmm. Maybe \"unassailable\" is an adjective, not a verb. So the main antonyms are \"overcome\" and \"rescued\". But I think \"overcome\" is more accurate. Let me confirm. Yes, \"overcome\" is a direct antonym. \"Rescued\" is less direct. So the answer should be \"overcome; rescued\". But wait, the user asked for maximum 2, and they want antonyms. So I'll go with those two.\n...done thinking.\n\novercome; rescued"
