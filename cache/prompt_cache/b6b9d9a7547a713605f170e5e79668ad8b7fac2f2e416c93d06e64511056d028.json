  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"elitist\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of \"elitist\" (an adjective). Let me think. Elitist means showing favoritism towards those from a particular class or group. So, synonyms could be words that mean something similar. Words like \"aristocratic\" come to mind, but that's more about being from a noble class. Then there's \"upper-class\" which refers to people from a high social class. But the user might want more direct synonyms. \"Classist\" is another one, as it relates to discrimination based on class. Wait, \"classist\" is more about the ideology than the person, but it's a close synonym. So maybe \"aristocratic\" and \"classist\" are the best options. Let me check if \"aristocratic\" is considered a synonym here. Yes, it's often used in the context of elitism. \"Upper-class\" is also a good one, but maybe the user wants more specific terms. So the two synonyms would be \"aristocratic\" and \"classist\". I should present them as a single string separated by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\naristocratic; classist"
