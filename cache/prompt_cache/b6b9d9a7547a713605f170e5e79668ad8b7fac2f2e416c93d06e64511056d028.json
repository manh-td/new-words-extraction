  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"elitist\" (an adjective). Let me think. First, I need to recall what synonyms are. Synonyms are words that have the same or nearly the same meaning.\n\n\"Elitist\" means showing favoritism towards the elite or those who are considered superior. So, words that convey a sense of superiority or preference for the upper class. \n\nI remember that \"aristocratic\" is often used to describe someone who belongs to a noble class. But is that exactly the same as \"elitist\"? Maybe, but sometimes \"aristocratic\" is more about the social class rather than the attitude. \n\nAnother possibility is \"snobish,\" which means showing disdain for those considered lower class or inferior. That's a bit different, but maybe related. \n\nWait, \"aristocratic\" is more about the class itself, while \"elitist\" is about the attitude. So maybe \"aristocratic\" is a good synonym here. \n\nAnother synonym could be \"upper-class,\" but that's more about the group rather than the attitude. So maybe \"aristocratic\" is better. \n\nI should check if there are other words. \"Elite\" is a noun, but maybe \"elitist\" can be synonymous with \"elite\" in some contexts. But the user wants synonyms as adjectives. \n\nSo the main ones are \"aristocratic\" and \"snobish\"? Or is \"snobish\" too specific? \n\nAlternatively, \"snob\" as a noun, but the user wants adjectives. \n\nSo the best synonyms would be \"aristocratic\" and \"snobish.\" But I need to make sure they are accurate. \n\nWait, \"snob\" as an adjective is \"snobish,\" which does mean showing superiority over the lower class. That's very close to \"elitist.\" \n\nSo the two synonyms would be \"aristocratic\" and \"snobish.\" \n\nI should present them as a single string separated by semicolons. So the answer would be \"aristocratic; snobish\".\n...done thinking.\n\naristocratic; snobish"
