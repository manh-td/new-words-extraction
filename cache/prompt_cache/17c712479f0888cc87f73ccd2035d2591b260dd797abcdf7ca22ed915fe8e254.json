  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bourgeoisie\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants antonyms for the word \"bourgeoisie\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"bourgeoisie\" means. From what I remember, it refers to the class of people who own the means of production in a capitalist society, often associated with the middle class in France, especially during the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nSo, the antonyms would be words that contrast with this class. The most obvious ones might be \"working class\" or \"working people,\" but I need to check if those are considered antonyms here. Also, in a broader sense, \"proletariat\" is the class that works for the bourgeoisie. But the question specifies \"antonyms\" for \"bourgeoisie\" as a noun, so maybe \"proletariat\" is the direct antonym. \n\nAnother possible antonym could be \"lower class\" or \"working class,\" but I should confirm if those are considered antonyms. However, \"proletariat\" is more specific and directly opposed to the bourgeoisie. So the answer should be \"proletariat\" and possibly \"working class.\" But the user wants maximum 2 antonyms. Let me check if \"working class\" is considered an antonym here. \n\nIn some contexts, \"bourgeoisie\" is seen as the opposite of \"proletariat,\" so \"proletariat\" is the primary antonym. The other possible antonym could be \"lower class,\" but that's a bit more general. However, the user might expect \"proletariat\" as the main antonym. So the answer should be \"proletariat\" and maybe \"working class,\" but I need to make sure. \n\nWait, the user said \"antonyms (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ). So if both \"proletariat\" and \"working class\" are valid, then the answer would be \"proletariat; working class.\" But I need to confirm if \"working class\" is considered an antonym. In Marxist theory, the proletariat is the class that doesn't own the means of production, while the bourgeoisie owns them. So \"working class\" is a broader term that includes the proletariat. However, in common usage, \"bourgeoisie\" is often associated with the middle class, so \"working class\" might not be the exact antonym. \n\nAlternatively, \"proletariat\" is the direct antonym. So the correct antonyms would be \"proletariat\" and \"working class.\" But I need to check if \"working class\" is considered an antonym here. Since the user might expect the more precise term, \"proletariat\" is the primary antonym. However, the question allows for up to two antonyms. So maybe the answer is \"proletariat; working class.\" But I should make sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"lower class\" is another antonym, but that's less precise. So the safest answer is \"proletariat; working class.\" But I need to verify. In some dictionaries, \"bourgeoisie\" is listed with \"proletariat\" as an antonym. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the answer is \"proletariat; working class.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nproletariat; working class"
