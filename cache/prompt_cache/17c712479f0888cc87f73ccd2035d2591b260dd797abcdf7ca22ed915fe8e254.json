  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bourgeoisie\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"bourgeoisie\" (noun). Let me start by recalling what \"bourgeoisie\" means. It refers to the middle class in a capitalist society, particularly the industrial and commercial class that owns the means of production. So, the antonyms would be words that contrast with this class.\n\nFirst, I need to think of classes that are opposite. The bourgeoisie is the upper class, so the antonyms might be the working class or the proletariat. But wait, \"proletariat\" is more specifically the class that works for the bourgeoisie. So, \"proletariat\" is a direct antonym. Then there's \"working class,\" but that's a broader term. The user might prefer the more specific term. Also, \"lower class\" or \"working class\" could be considered, but \"proletariat\" is more precise. \n\nAre there other antonyms? Maybe \"commoners\" or \"masses,\" but those are more general. The user asked for maximum two antonyms, so I should pick the most accurate. So the answer would be \"proletariat\" and \"working class,\" but since the user wants antonyms, maybe \"proletariat\" is the primary one, and \"working class\" is another. But I need to check if \"working class\" is considered an antonym here. \n\nAlternatively, \"lower class\" could be another, but I think \"proletariat\" is the most accurate. So the answer should be \"proletariat; working class.\" But I need to make sure that these are indeed antonyms. Yes, \"bourgeoisie\" is the upper class, and \"proletariat\" is the lower class. \"Working class\" is similar but a bit more general. So the two antonyms would be \"proletariat\" and \"working class.\" But the user might prefer the more specific term. However, since the question allows for maximum two, and both are valid, I'll list them as such.\n...done thinking.\n\nproletariat; working class"
