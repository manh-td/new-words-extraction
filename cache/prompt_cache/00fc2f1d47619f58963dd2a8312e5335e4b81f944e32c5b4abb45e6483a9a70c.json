  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"emanates\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user wants the antonyms of \"emanates\" in plain text. First, I need to recall what the opposite of \"emanates\" means. \"Emanates\" means to emit or come from a particular direction, like a sound or a scent. So antonyms would be things that don't emit or come from a particular place.\n\nPossible antonyms could be \"recedes\" (to move away), \"dissipates\" (to spread out), \"vanishes\" (to disappear), \"retreats\" (to move back). But I need to check which ones are most accurate. \"Recedes\" is a good one because it's about moving away. \"Dissipates\" is more about spreading out, but maybe \"vanishes\" is more direct. However, the user asked for antonyms, so maybe \"recedes\" and \"vanishes\" are the best choices. Wait, but \"dissipates\" is also a valid antonym. Let me think. \"Emanates\" is about emitting, so antonyms would be things that don't emit. \"Vanishes\" is more about disappearing entirely, while \"dissipates\" is about spreading out. \"Recedes\" is about moving away. So maybe the top two are \"recedes\" and \"vanishes\". But I need to check if these are standard antonyms. Alternatively, \"dissipates\" might be considered an antonym. Hmm. The user wants maximum two, so I'll go with \"recedes\" and \"vanishes\". But I should make sure. Another thought: \"retreats\" is also a possible antonym, but maybe \"recedes\" is more commonly used. So the answer would be \"recedes; vanishes\" or \"recedes; dissipates\". Wait, \"dissipates\" is more about spreading out, not necessarily stopping the emission. So maybe \"recedes\" and \"vanishes\" are better. I think that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nrecedes; vanishes"
