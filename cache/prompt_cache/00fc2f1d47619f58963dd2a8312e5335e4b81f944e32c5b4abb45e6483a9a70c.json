  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"emanates\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"emanates\" in plain text, max two. First, I need to recall what \"emanates\" means. It's to emit or produce something, like a scent or a sound. So antonyms would be things that don't emit or produce. \n\nWhat comes to mind? \"Exits\" is a direct antonym because it means to leave, which is the opposite of emitting. Then \"recedes\" might work too, as it means to move back, which could be the opposite of emitting. But wait, \"recedes\" is more about movement than emission. Maybe \"exits\" is better. \n\nAnother option could be \"disappears,\" but that's more about vanishing. \"Exits\" is more about leaving, which is directly opposite. \"Recedes\" is more about moving back, but maybe in context, it's acceptable. Let me check. \n\nThe user asked for antonyms, so both \"exits\" and \"recedes\" could be valid. But maybe \"exits\" is more precise. So the answer would be \"exits; recedes\". But I need to make sure. Alternatively, \"vanishes\" might be another one, but that's more about disappearing. \n\nWait, the user said maximum two, so maybe two. So the correct antonyms are \"exits\" and \"recedes\". But I should confirm. Let me think again. \"Emanates\" means to produce something, so the antonyms would be things that don't produce. \"Exits\" is to leave, which is the opposite of producing. \"Recedes\" is to move back, which is not directly opposite. Maybe \"vanishes\" is better. But the user might expect \"exits\" and \"recedes\" as the main antonyms. \n\nAlternatively, \"disappears\" is another possible antonym. But I think \"exits\" is more direct. So the answer is \"exits; recedes\".\n...done thinking.\n\nexits; recedes"
