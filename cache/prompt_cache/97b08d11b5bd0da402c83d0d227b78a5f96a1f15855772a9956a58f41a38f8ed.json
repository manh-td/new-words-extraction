  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"rekindled\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants synonyms for \"rekindled\" as a verb. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Rekindled\" means to revive or reignite something, like a fire or a passion. So synonyms would be words that mean to revive or renew.\n\nThinking of common verbs... \"Rekindled\" is similar to \"rekindled\" in meaning. Maybe \"rekindled\" is a bit rare, so common synonyms might be \"revived\" or \"rekindled\" itself. Wait, but the user wants synonyms, so \"revived\" is a direct synonym. Another one could be \"renewed,\" because renewing something can mean to revive it. Let me check if those are accurate.\n\n\"Revived\" means to bring back to life, which fits. \"Renewed\" means to make something new or to restore something to its original state, which also applies here. So both \"revived\" and \"renewed\" are valid synonyms. I should present them as the answer, joined by semicolons. Let me make sure there are only two and they're correct. Yep, that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nrevived; renewed"
