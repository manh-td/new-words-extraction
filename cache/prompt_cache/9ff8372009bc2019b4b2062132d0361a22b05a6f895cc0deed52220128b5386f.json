Like \"The gardener is fostering a new variety of flower.\" That uses the noun form. \n\nSecond sentence: Perhaps something related to a child or a skill. \"The teacher is fostering a love for learning in her students.\" That fits the noun usage. \n\nI should check if these sentences are correct and make sure they use \"fostering\" as a noun. Yep, both sentences use it correctly. No need for any extra info, just the sentences. Alright, formatted as requested.\n...done thinking.\n\nfostering a new plant in a greenhouse; fostering a passion for music in young learners"
