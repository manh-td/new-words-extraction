  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences for the word \"bourgeoisie\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"bourgeoisie\" means. It refers to the upper class in a capitalist society, especially those who own industry and capital. So, the sentences should reflect that.\n\nThe user specified maximum two sentences. Let me start with the first one. Maybe something about the social class in a capitalist country. Like, \"The bourgeoisie dominated the economy during the Industrial Revolution.\" That's straightforward.\n\nFor the second sentence, I need to highlight the contrast with the working class. Perhaps, \"The working class struggled against the oppressive rules of the bourgeoisie.\" That shows the tension between the two classes.\n\nWait, are there any other contexts? Maybe in a different setting, like a specific historical period. But the user didn't mention that, so sticking to the general case is better. Also, check if the examples are correct. Yes, \"bourgeoisie\" is indeed the upper class in a capitalist society. \n\nI should make sure the sentences are correct and not too complex. Avoid any errors. Alright, that should cover it.\n...done thinking.\n\nbourgeoisie; The bourgeoisie controlled the economy during the Industrial Revolution.  \nbourgeoisie; The working class fought against the oppressive rules of the bourgeoisie."
