  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences for the word \"bourgeoisie\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the term. The bourgeoisie is the class in French society that owns the means of production, right? So in English, it's often used in the context of social classes.\n\nI should create two sentences that show different uses. Maybe one where it's part of a historical context, like in the French Revolution, and another where it's in a modern context. Let me check if the examples are accurate. \n\nThe first sentence could be about the French Revolution, mentioning the bourgeoisie and their role. The second sentence might talk about modern society, like how the bourgeoisie influences politics. I need to make sure the sentences are correct and use the word in the right context. Also, the user wants it in the format sentence 1; sentence 2, no explanation. Alright, that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nbourgeoisie in the French Revolution led to widespread social upheaval; the bourgeoisie today continues to shape political and economic policies."
