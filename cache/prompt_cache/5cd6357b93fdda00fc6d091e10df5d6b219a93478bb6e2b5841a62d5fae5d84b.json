  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"groomed\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to create two example sentences using the word \"groomed\" as an adjective. Let me think about how to use it correctly.\n\nFirst, \"groomed\" means to train or teach, like training a dog. So maybe something like \"The trainer groomed the dog for the competition.\" That uses the past tense. \n\nAnother example could be \"She groomed her horse for the show,\" using the past tense again. Wait, but the word is an adjective here. Oh, right, \"groomed\" is an adjective meaning trained or prepared. So maybe \"The chef groomed the ingredients for the meal.\" That works. \n\nWait, the first example I thought of is correct. The second one could be \"The coach groomed the players for the game.\" But maybe the second example is better as \"The teacher groomed the students for the exam.\" Hmm, but the user wants maximum two sentences. Let me check if both are valid. \n\nYes, both sentences use \"groomed\" as an adjective in the past tense. So the answer should be those two sentences.\n...done thinking.\n\ngroomed; the trainer groomed the dog for the competition; the chef groomed the ingredients for the meal"
