  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"drudgery\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences using the word \"drudgery\" as a noun. Let me think. Drudgery means hard work, especially boring or repetitive. So sentences should show that.\n\nFirst sentence: Maybe something like \"The job involved drudgery, but the pay was decent.\" That shows the effort but acknowledges the compensation. \n\nSecond sentence: \"She found drudgery in her daily routine, but she managed to find some joy in it.\" Here, she's talking about her own experience, showing both the burden and the small positive aspect.\n\nCheck if these are appropriate. They use the noun form correctly. The first one mentions the job, the second her routine. Yep, that works. No need for more sentences. Make sure it's exactly as requested, no JSON or explanation. Alright, formatted as specified.\n...done thinking.\n\ndrudgery; the job involved drudgery, but the pay was decent; she found drudgery in her daily routine, but she managed to find some joy in it"
