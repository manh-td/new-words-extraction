So, maybe something like a job that's really hard. \n\nFirst sentence: Maybe \"The job at the factory was so drudgery that the workers were exhausted.\" Wait, that sounds a bit wordy. Maybe \"The drudgery of repetitive tasks was unbearable.\" That's better. \n\nSecond sentence: \"She found the drudgery of daily chores frustrating.\" That works. Let me check if those sentences are correct and fit the context. Yes, they use \"drudgery\" as a noun and describe situations where it's tedious. Alright, that should do it.\n...done thinking.\n\nThe drudgery of repetitive tasks was unbearable; the workers struggled to keep up. She found the drudgery of daily chores frustrating."
