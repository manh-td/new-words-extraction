  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"tactile\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"tactile\" as an adjective. Let me start by recalling what \"tactile\" means. It refers to something that can be touched or is related to touch. So synonyms would be words that mean something related to touch or feeling.\n\nFirst, I need to think of other adjectives that describe something related to touch. Words like \"sensory\" come to mind because sensory experiences involve touch. Then there's \"touch\" itself, but that's a noun. Maybe \"kinesthetic\"? Wait, kinesthetic is more about movement and feeling, but does it fit here? Hmm.\n\nAnother possibility is \"physical,\" but that's a bit broader. \"Vestibular\" relates to balance, maybe not exactly touch. \"Visceral\" is about the stomach area, so that's not it. \"Somatic\" refers to the somatic nervous system, which is involved in body sensations. That might be a good synonym.\n\nSo, the main ones would be \"sensory\" and \"somatic.\" Let me check if those are accurate. \"Sensory\" is definitely related to touch, as in the senses. \"Somatic\" is about the body's sensations, so that's correct. \"Kinesthetic\" is more about movement, but sometimes used in contexts related to touch. However, the user asked for synonyms for \"tactile\" as an adjective, so \"sensory\" and \"somatic\" are more directly related. \n\nWait, \"somatic\" is an adjective, so that's good. \"Sensory\" is also an adjective. So the two synonyms would be \"sensory\" and \"somatic.\" Let me make sure there aren't any others. \"Tactile\" can also be \"touch\" but that's a noun. So the answer should be those two. I think that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nsensory;somatic"
