  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"tactile\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user asked for synonyms of \"tactile\" (an adjective). First, I need to recall what \"tactile\" means. It refers to something that can be touched or perceived through the senses, especially touch. So synonyms would be words that mean something that can be felt or sensed by touch.\n\nHmm, \"tactile\" is related to touch, so possible synonyms might be \"touch-related\" but that's a bit too broad. Maybe \"sensory\"? Wait, \"sensory\" is more general, like any sense, not just touch. Then there's \"physical\" but that's more about the body. Oh, \"kinesthetic\" is about movement and feeling, but that's more about movement than touch. \n\nWait, \"tactile\" is specifically about touch. So maybe \"sensory\" is a good synonym because it includes touch. Another one could be \"physical\" but I think \"sensory\" is more accurate here. Let me check. \"Sensory\" is often used in contexts like sensory perception, which includes touch. \"Tactile\" is a type of sensory. So \"sensory\" would be a synonym. \n\nAre there any other words? \"Tactile\" can also be associated with \"touch\" in a more specific way. \"Tactile\" is sometimes used in the context of something that can be felt, like \"tactile materials\" or \"tactile experiences.\" So \"sensory\" is a good synonym. Another possible synonym is \"touch-sensitive,\" but that's more about the ability to sense touch. However, the user asked for synonyms in general, not necessarily specific to touch. \n\nSo the main synonyms would be \"sensory\" and \"touch-sensitive.\" But maybe \"sensory\" is more common. Let me confirm. In dictionaries, \"sensory\" is often listed as a synonym for tactile. So the answer should be \"sensory; touch-sensitive.\" But the user wants maximum two synonyms. Wait, the user said \"maximum 2\" but if there are multiple, join them. So if both are valid, then both are acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, \"tactile\" can also be considered as \"touch-related,\" but that's more of a descriptor. So \"sensory\" and \"touch-sensitive\" are better. But maybe \"sensory\" is the primary synonym. Let me check if \"sensory\" is considered a synonym here. Yes, in the context of touch, \"sensory\" is a synonym. So the answer would be \"sensory; touch-sensitive.\" But maybe the user expects \"sensory\" only. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, \"tactile\" can also be associated with \"physical,\" but \"physical\" is more general. So the best synonyms are \"sensory\" and \"touch-sensitive.\" But the user might want the most common ones. So I'll go with \"sensory; touch-sensitive.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nsensory; touch-sensitive"
