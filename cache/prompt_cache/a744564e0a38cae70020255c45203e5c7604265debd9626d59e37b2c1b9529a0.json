  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"fostering\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for antonyms of the word \"fostering\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"fostering\" means. As a noun, it refers to the act of promoting or encouraging the growth of something, like a plant or a person. So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of promoting or encouraging.\n\nThinking about synonyms first might help. Words like \"cultivating\" or \"sowing\" come to mind, but the user wants antonyms. So the opposite of promoting would be something that inhibits or prevents growth. Words like \"hindering,\" \"preventing,\" or \"blocking\" could work. But I need to check if these are accurate.\n\nAnother angle: \"fostering\" can also mean nurturing, so antonyms might be \"discouraging,\" \"rejecting,\" or \"neglecting.\" However, the user specified \"antonyms\" and wants the maximum of two. Let me think of the most common antonyms. \"Oppressing\" might be too strong, but \"hindering\" is a good fit. \"Oppressing\" could be a possible antonym, but maybe \"hindering\" is more direct. \n\nWait, \"fostering\" as a noun is more about the act of promoting, so the antonym would be something that stops or prevents that. So \"hindering\" or \"preventing\" are good. But maybe \"opposing\" is also a possibility. However, \"opposing\" is more about opposing a movement or action, which might not be the exact opposite of fostering. \n\nI think the best antonyms here are \"hindering\" and \"preventing.\" But let me check if there's a more accurate term. \"Oppressing\" might be too strong, but it's a valid antonym. However, the user might expect more common words. So \"hindering\" and \"preventing\" are likely the top choices. \n\nWait, the user said \"maximum 2,\" so I can list two. Let me confirm. \"Hindering\" and \"preventing\" are both antonyms. So the answer would be \"hindering; preventing.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nhindering; preventing"
