  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"fostering\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"fostering\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Fostering\" as a noun means the act of cultivating or nurturing something, like fostering a relationship or a plant.\n\nSo, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. The direct antonyms here might be something like \"destroying\" or \"withering\". But wait, \"withering\" is more about decay, while \"destroying\" is more about obliteration. Which is more accurate?\n\nAnother angle: \"fostering\" implies growth or development. So antonyms could be \"dissolving\", \"eroding\", or \"withering\". But \"eroding\" is more about wearing away, while \"withering\" is about dying. Which is more precise?\n\nIn dictionary terms, \"withering\" might be a better antonym because it directly opposes the act of nurturing. \"Destroying\" is more about causing damage, which is a bit different. So between \"withering\" and \"destroying\", which is more appropriate?\n\nI think \"withering\" is the better choice here. So the antonym would be \"withering\". But wait, maybe there's another one. Let me think. \"Oppressing\" is not exactly opposite. \"Eroding\" is more about wearing away. So maybe \"withering\" is the main antonym. But the user asked for maximum two, so maybe \"withering\" and \"destroying\"? Or is there another?\n\nWait, \"fostering\" can also mean to cultivate, so antonyms might be \"weakening\", \"dulling\", \"withering\". But \"weakening\" is more about reducing strength. \"Dulling\" is about making dull. \"Withering\" is about dying. Which is more accurate?\n\nIn standard dictionaries, \"withering\" is often listed as an antonym for \"fostering\" in some contexts. So I'll go with \"withering\" as the main antonym. Since the user asked for maximum two, maybe there's another. But I'm not sure. Let me check again. Maybe \"eroding\" is also an antonym? But I think \"withering\" is more precise. So the answer would be \"withering\".\n...done thinking.\n\nwithering; eroding"
