  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"guise\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"guise\" as a verb. Let me start by making sure I understand what \"guise\" means. As a verb, \"guise\" means to present oneself in a particular way, often to deceive or to disguise one's true nature. So, the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of disguising or pretending.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean to reveal one's true self or to be authentic. Words like \"truth\" come to mind. Then there's \"real\" or \"authentic.\" But wait, the user wants antonyms, so maybe \"truth\" is better. Another possible antonym is \"sincerity,\" but that's a noun. Let me check if \"truth\" is considered an antonym here. Yes, because it's the opposite of deception.\n\nAnother thought: \"real\" as an adjective could be an antonym, but the user might prefer more specific terms. \"Authentic\" is also a good one. So, the antonyms would be \"truth\" and \"authentic.\" But I need to make sure these are correct. Let me verify. \"Guise\" means to disguise, so antonyms would be words that mean to be genuine or truthful. \"Truth\" and \"authentic\" fit. However, \"real\" is also a possible antonym, but maybe \"authentic\" is more precise. So, the answer should be \"truth; authentic.\" But I need to check if the user wants the maximum of two. Yes, two is allowed. So the final answer is \"truth; authentic.\"\n...done thinking.\n\ntruth; authentic"
