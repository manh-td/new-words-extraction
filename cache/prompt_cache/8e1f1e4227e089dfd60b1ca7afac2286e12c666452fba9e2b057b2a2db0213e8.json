  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"guise\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"guise\" when it's used as a verb. Let me start by making sure I understand what \"guise\" means. As a verb, \"guise\" means to present oneself in a particular way, often to disguise one's true nature. So, the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of disguising or pretending.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean to reveal one's true self or to be authentic. Words like \"truth\" come to mind. But \"truth\" is more of a noun. Maybe \"real\" or \"authentic\"? Wait, \"real\" can be an adjective, but does it fit here? \"Real\" as an adjective means genuine, so maybe that's a good antonym.\n\nAnother possibility is \"nature,\" but that's more about the inherent self. \"Nature\" is a bit more abstract. Then there's \"essence,\" which is similar to nature. But the user might prefer more common words. \n\nWait, \"guise\" is about pretending, so the antonyms would be words that mean to be genuine, honest, or true. So \"truth\" is a direct antonym. \"Real\" is another common antonym. \"Authentic\" is also possible, but maybe too formal. \n\nSo the two antonyms would be \"truth\" and \"real.\" But I need to check if \"real\" is acceptable. In some contexts, \"real\" can be used as an adjective, so it's okay. Alternatively, \"authentic\" might be better, but the user might want the most common answers. \n\nSo the answer should be \"truth; real\" or \"truth; authentic.\" But the user said maximum 2, so either is fine. Let me confirm. \"Truth\" is a direct antonym, and \"real\" is also a good one. \"Authentic\" is another option, but maybe the user wants more common words. So I'll go with \"truth; real.\"\n...done thinking.\n\ntruth; real"
