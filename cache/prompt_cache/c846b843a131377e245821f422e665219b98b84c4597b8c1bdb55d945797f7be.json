  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"guise\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"guise\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"guise\" means. From what I know, \"guise\" refers to the appearance or form that someone takes, especially to conceal their true identity. So, synonyms would be words that mean the same thing.\n\nFirst, I should think of common nouns that mean disguise or appearance. Words like \"mask\" come to mind because a mask is something you wear to hide your face, which is similar to a guise. Then there's \"mask\" as a noun. Another possible synonym might be \"form,\" but that's more about the structure rather than the appearance. \"Appearance\" is a bit broader, but maybe too general. \"Cloak\" could work, but I'm not sure if that's the most precise. \n\nWait, the user specified \"noun,\" so I need to make sure the synonyms are nouns. \"Mask\" is definitely a noun. \"Form\" is a noun too, but does it fit exactly? \"Form\" can mean the way something is structured, which might not be the same as a disguise. \"Appearance\" is a noun but might be considered more general. \n\nSo the best synonyms here would be \"mask\" and \"form.\" But I need to check if \"form\" is commonly used as a synonym for guise. Maybe \"mask\" is more direct. Let me confirm. Yes, \"mask\" is a direct synonym, and \"form\" is more about the structure. So the answer should be \"mask; form.\" But wait, the user asked for maximum two synonyms. So both are acceptable. I should present them as a single string separated by semicolons. That's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nmask; form"
