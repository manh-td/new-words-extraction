  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"guise\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for synonyms of the word \"guise\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"guise\" means. From what I remember, \"guise\" is a noun that refers to the appearance or manner in which someone acts, especially to disguise their true self. So, it's about acting in a different way.\n\nNow, I need to think of other words that mean the same thing. Let me brainstorm. Words that mean disguise or act in a different way. \"Act\" comes to mind, but that's more of a verb. \"Mask\" is a noun and means a covering, which is related. \"Appearance\" is a synonym for guise, but that's more general. \"Mask\" is a direct synonym. \"Acting\" is a verb, so maybe not. \"Appearance\" is a bit broad. \"Dress\" could be a synonym, but that's more about clothing. \"Role\" is another possibility, but that's more about a role in a play. \n\nWait, \"mask\" is a direct synonym. \"Act\" as a verb is not a noun, so maybe not. \"Appearance\" is a noun, but it's more general. \"Disguise\" is the same as the original word, so that's not a synonym. \"Acting\" is a verb. So the best synonyms would be \"mask\" and \"appearance\". But I need to check if \"appearance\" is considered a synonym here. Sometimes, \"appearance\" can be used in a similar way, but \"mask\" is more specific. So the answer should be \"mask; appearance\". Let me confirm. Yes, \"mask\" is a direct synonym, and \"appearance\" is a more general term. So the answer is those two.\n...done thinking.\n\nmask; appearance"
