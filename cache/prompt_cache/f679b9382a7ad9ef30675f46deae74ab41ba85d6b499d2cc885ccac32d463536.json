  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"eroded\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences using the word \"eroded\" as an adjective. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Eroded\" is an adjective meaning worn away by something like water, acid, or time.\n\nSo, possible sentences could be something like \"The stone was eroded by the rain over time.\" Another one might be \"The ancient statue's surface was eroded by the elements.\" Wait, but the user said maximum two sentences. Let me check if those are accurate.\n\nYes, \"eroded\" as an adjective is correct. The first sentence uses \"eroded by the rain,\" and the second uses \"eroded by the elements.\" Both are valid. I should present them in the required format. No JSON, just the sentences separated by semicolons. Alright, that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nstone was eroded by the rain over time; the ancient statue's surface was eroded by the elements."
