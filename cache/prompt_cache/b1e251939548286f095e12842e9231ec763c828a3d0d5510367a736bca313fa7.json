  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"attestation\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user wants the antonyms of \"attestation\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"attestation\" means. It's a noun that refers to a formal statement or proof, like a document that verifies something is true.\n\nSo, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. The opposite of a statement or proof might be something like a denial or a contradiction. But wait, the user specified \"antonyms\" for the noun. Let me think of possible words.\n\n\"Attestation\" is related to verification, so antonyms could be \"denial\" or \"contradiction\". But maybe \"denial\" is more direct. Another possibility is \"rebuttal\", but that's more about opposing a claim. \"Rebuttal\" might be a bit more specific. \n\nWait, the user wants maximum two antonyms. So I need to pick the best two. \"Denial\" and \"rebuttal\" might both be valid. Let me check if those are correct. \n\nYes, \"denial\" is a direct antonym, as it's the opposite of attestation. \"Rebuttal\" is a form of opposition, but maybe not as direct. Alternatively, \"contradiction\" is also a possible antonym. But \"contradiction\" is more about conflicting statements, whereas \"denial\" is more about refusing to accept something. \n\nSo maybe \"denial\" and \"contradiction\" are the best antonyms. But I need to confirm. Let me think again. \"Attestation\" is a formal proof, so antonyms would be things that negate that. \"Denial\" is a direct opposite. \"Contradiction\" is more about conflicting statements. \n\nAlternatively, \"rebuttal\" could be considered an antonym, but maybe \"denial\" is more accurate. So the answer would be \"denial; contradiction\" or \"denial; rebuttal\". \n\nBut I need to check if \"rebuttal\" is considered an antonym here. Since the user wants noun antonyms, \"rebuttal\" is a noun. So both \"denial\" and \"rebuttal\" are valid. However, \"contradiction\" is also a possible antonym. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best two are \"denial\" and \"rebuttal\". But I should stick to the most direct antonyms. Alternatively, \"denial\" and \"contradiction\" might be more accurate. \n\nI think the correct antonyms are \"denial\" and \"contradiction\". So the answer would be \"denial; contradiction\".\n...done thinking.\n\ndenial; contradiction"
