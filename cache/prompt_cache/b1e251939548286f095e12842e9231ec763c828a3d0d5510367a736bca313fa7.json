  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"attestation\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user asked for antonyms of \"attestation\" (noun). First, I need to make sure I understand what an attestation is. From what I know, an attestation is a formal statement or confirmation, often required for legal or official purposes. So, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of a statement or confirmation.\n\nPossible antonyms could be something like \"denial,\" \"rejection,\" \"disclaimer,\" or \"negation.\" But I need to check if these are correct. \"Denial\" is a direct antonym, as in refusing to admit something. \"Rejection\" might be more about rejecting a request, but \"attestation\" is about confirming, so \"rejection\" could be a bit off. \"Disclaimer\" is more about a statement that something isn't true, which is similar. \"Negation\" is also a strong antonym.\n\nWait, the user wants maximum two antonyms. So I should pick the most accurate ones. \"Denial\" and \"negation\" are both direct antonyms. \"Rejection\" might be closer to \"denial\" in some contexts, but \"negation\" is more about the act of denying. So maybe \"denial\" and \"negation\" are better. But I need to confirm if \"rejection\" is considered an antonym here. Alternatively, \"disclaimer\" is another possibility. But maybe the user expects more common antonyms. Let me think again.\n\nIn legal terms, \"attestation\" is often used in documents, so antonyms might include \"denial\" and \"rejection.\" But \"rejection\" is more about refusing a request, whereas \"denial\" is about refusing to admit. So \"denial\" is more accurate. \"Negation\" is also a good one. So the two antonyms would be \"denial\" and \"negation.\" But I need to check if \"disclaimer\" is considered an antonym. Maybe not as direct. So the answer should be \"denial; negation.\"\n...done thinking.\n\ndenial; negation"
