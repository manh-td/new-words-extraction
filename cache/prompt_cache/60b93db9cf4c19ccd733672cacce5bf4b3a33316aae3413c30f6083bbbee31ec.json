  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"provincials\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of \"provincials\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"provincials\" means. From what I know, \"provincials\" refers to people or things from a particular province or region. So, synonyms would be words that mean people from a specific area.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that can replace \"provincials.\" Words like \"regional\" come to mind because they refer to people from a specific region. Another possible synonym is \"local,\" but that might be too general. \"Regional\" is more specific and fits well with \"provincials.\" \n\nWait, are there other options? \"Territorials\" is another term, but that's more about territories rather than people. So \"regional\" and \"local\" might be the best synonyms here. Let me check if \"local\" is considered a synonym in this context. Yes, \"local\" can mean people from a particular place, so that's valid. \n\nSo the two synonyms would be \"regional\" and \"local.\" I should present them as a single string separated by semicolons. Let me make sure there's no mistake. \"Regional; local\" seems correct. I don't think there are other common synonyms for \"provincials\" as a noun. Alright, that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nregional; local"
