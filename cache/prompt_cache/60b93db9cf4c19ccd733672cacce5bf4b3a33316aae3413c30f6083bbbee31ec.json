  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"provincials\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for synonyms of \"provincials\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"provincials\" means. From what I know, \"provincials\" refers to people or things from a particular province or region. So, they are regional or local inhabitants.\n\nNow, looking for synonyms. The word \"regional\" comes to mind because it refers to something related to a region. Another possible synonym might be \"local,\" but I need to check if that's accurate. \"Local\" is more general, like something that's in a specific area, but \"regional\" is more specific, like something related to a region rather than a local community.\n\nWait, \"regional\" is a good fit here. \"Local\" could work too, but maybe \"regional\" is more precise. Let me think again. \"Provincials\" are people from a province, so \"regional\" would be the synonym. Are there other options? \"Area\" might not be a direct synonym. \"Residents\" is more about people living in a place, but \"provincials\" is more about the people from the province. \n\nSo the best synonyms would be \"regional\" and \"local.\" But I need to check if \"local\" is considered a synonym here. Sometimes \"local\" can be used in the same way, but maybe \"regional\" is more accurate. Let me confirm. Yes, \"regional\" is a direct synonym for \"provincials\" as a noun. \"Local\" is also acceptable, but maybe \"regional\" is the better choice here. So the answer should be \"regional; local.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nregional; local"
