  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"eroded\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"eroded\" as an adjective. Let me start by recalling what \"eroded\" means. It's an adjective that describes something that has been worn away by erosion, like by water or wind. So, the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of being eroded.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean to wear away or to damage. Words like \"carved\" come to mind, but wait, \"carved\" is more about shaping with tools, not necessarily erosion. Maybe \"corroded\"? That's more about rusting from exposure to moisture. But \"corroded\" is a noun, so maybe not. \n\nAnother possibility is \"weathered,\" which means worn away by the elements. That's a good antonym. Then there's \"eroded\" itself, but the user wants antonyms, not the word itself. So \"weathered\" is a valid antonym. \n\nWait, \"eroded\" is an adjective, so the antonyms would be nouns or other adjectives. But the user specified antonyms, so maybe \"unweathered\" or \"undamaged\"? But \"undamaged\" is more of a noun. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, \"eroded\" can also mean to be weakened, so \"weakened\" is another antonym. But \"weakened\" is more of a verb. Wait, the user wants antonyms for the adjective. So \"weakened\" as an adjective would be a possible antonym. \n\nBut I need to check if \"weakened\" is commonly used as an adjective. Maybe \"weakened\" is more of a verb. Let me think. The adjective form of \"weaken\" is \"weakened,\" which can mean something that has been weakened. So yes, that's an antonym. \n\nSo possible antonyms are \"weathered\" and \"weakened.\" But I need to make sure. Another word could be \"repaired,\" but that's more about fixing, not opposite. \"Repaired\" is a verb. \n\nSo the two antonyms would be \"weathered\" and \"weakened.\" But wait, \"weakened\" as an adjective might not be the most accurate. Let me check. \"Weathered\" is more about being worn by the elements, while \"weakened\" is about being damaged or reduced in strength. Both are valid antonyms. \n\nAlternatively, \"unweathered\" is also an antonym, but that's a noun. The user might expect \"weathered\" and \"unweathered\" as antonyms, but since the user asked for antonyms (which can be nouns or adjectives), maybe \"weathered\" is the primary one. \n\nSo the answer should be \"weathered; weakened\" or \"weathered; unweathered.\" But the user said maximum 2, so maybe \"weathered; weakened\" is the correct pair. Let me confirm. \n\nYes, \"weathered\" and \"weakened\" are both antonyms for \"eroded\" as an adjective. So the final answer is \"weathered; weakened\".\n...done thinking.\n\nweathered; weakened"
