  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"eroded\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of the word \"eroded\" as an adjective. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"eroded\" means. It's an adjective describing something that has been worn away by something else, like water or time.\n\nSo, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. The opposite of \"eroded\" would be something that hasn't been worn away. So, maybe words like \"repaired\" or \"restored\"? Wait, but the user specified \"adjective,\" so I need to check if those are adjectives. \"Repaired\" is an adjective, and \"restored\" is also an adjective. \n\nAre there any other common antonyms? Maybe \"intact\" or \"undamaged\"? But \"intact\" is more of a noun or adjective, and \"undamaged\" is also an adjective. However, the user might expect more common antonyms. \n\nWait, \"eroded\" can also be a verb, but the question specifies it's an adjective. So, the antonyms would be words that describe something not eroded. So, \"repaired\" and \"restored\" are good ones. \n\nI should check if there are any other common antonyms. Maybe \"new\" or \"untouched\"? But \"new\" is more about the state of being new, not necessarily the opposite of eroded. \"Untouched\" is an adjective, but it's more about not being touched, which is a bit different. \n\nSo, the most accurate antonyms here would be \"repaired\" and \"restored.\" Let me confirm. If something is repaired, it's fixed, so it's not eroded. Restored means bringing back to a previous state, so it's also not eroded. \n\nYes, those are the correct antonyms. So the answer should be \"repaired; restored.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nrepaired; restored"
