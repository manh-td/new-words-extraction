  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bourgeoisie\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"bourgeoisie\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"bourgeoisie\" means. It refers to the middle class in a capitalist society, particularly the bourgeoisie in France, which is the class that owns industry and commerce.\n\nSo, I need to think of other nouns that mean the same thing. The primary synonym here would be \"middle class.\" But wait, is that considered a direct synonym? Sometimes, \"middle class\" is more general, while \"bourgeoisie\" is specific to the French context. However, in common usage, they are often used interchangeably.\n\nAnother possible synonym might be \"working class,\" but that's more about the lower class. \"Bourgeoisie\" is specifically the upper middle class. So maybe \"upper middle class\" is more accurate, but the user might expect a more general term. \n\nAlternatively, \"middle class\" is a common synonym. Let me check if there are other terms. \"Class\" is too general. \"Bourgeois\" is the adjective form. So the main synonyms are \"middle class\" and \"upper middle class.\" But since the user asked for maximum two, and if \"upper middle class\" is considered a synonym, then that's two. However, sometimes \"middle class\" is accepted as a synonym even if it's more general. \n\nWait, the user specified \"noun,\" so \"middle class\" is a noun. \"Upper middle class\" is also a noun. But maybe the user wants the most common synonym. In standard dictionaries, \"middle class\" is often used as a synonym. So the answer would be \"middle class;\" but maybe \"upper middle class\" is also acceptable. However, since the user wants maximum two, and if \"middle class\" is the primary one, then that's it. Alternatively, if \"upper middle class\" is considered a synonym, then both. But I need to check if that's acceptable. \n\nIn many contexts, \"middle class\" is the go-to synonym. So the answer would be \"middle class;\" but maybe the user wants more specific terms. However, without more context, I'll go with the most common synonym.\n...done thinking.\n\nmiddle class; upper middle class"
