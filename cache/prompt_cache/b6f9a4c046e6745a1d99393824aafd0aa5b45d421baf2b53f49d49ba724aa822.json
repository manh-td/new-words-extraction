  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bourgeoisie\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of \"bourgeoisie\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"bourgeoisie\" means. It refers to the middle class in a capitalist society, particularly the people who own businesses and property, often associated with the bourgeoisie in Marxist theory.\n\nSo, I need to think of other nouns that mean the same thing. The primary synonym here would be \"middle class.\" But wait, is there another common term? In some contexts, \"working class\" might be used, but that's more about the lower class. Another possibility is \"middle class,\" which is pretty much the same. \n\nI should check if there are any other synonyms. In French, \"bourgeoisie\" is \"bourgeois,\" but the user is asking for English synonyms. Maybe \"middle class\" is the main one. Are there any other terms? \"Economic class\" could work, but that's more general. \"Social class\" is broader. \n\nSo the most accurate synonyms here are \"middle class\" and \"working class.\" But wait, \"working class\" is more about the lower class, so maybe \"middle class\" is better. Alternatively, \"bourgeois\" itself is a synonym, but the user wants synonyms for \"bourgeoisie,\" not the term itself. \n\nSo the answer should be \"middle class;\" maybe \"working class\" if allowed. But I need to make sure. In some contexts, \"bourgeoisie\" is referred to as the \"middle class,\" so that's the primary synonym. The other possible is \"middle class,\" but maybe the user wants more specific. \n\nAlternatively, \"bourgeoisie\" can also be called \"the middle class,\" so the answer would be \"middle class.\" But since the user asked for synonyms, and if there are multiple, join them. So maybe just \"middle class\" as the only synonym. Wait, but maybe \"working class\" is also acceptable. \n\nHmm, I think the most accurate and commonly used synonym is \"middle class.\" So the answer is \"middle class.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nmiddle class"
