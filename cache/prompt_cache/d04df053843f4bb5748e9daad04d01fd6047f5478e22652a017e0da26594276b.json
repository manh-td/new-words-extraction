  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"elitist\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"elitist\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"elitist\" means. It refers to someone who belongs to or supports a particular elite group, often implying superiority over others.\n\nNow, I need to think of other nouns that have similar meanings. Words like \"elite\" itself are close, but the user wants synonyms for \"elitist\" as a noun. So, maybe \"upper class\" or \"aristocrat\"? Wait, \"upper class\" is more about the social class, while \"aristocrat\" is more specific to those in high society. Both could be considered synonyms.\n\nAnother possibility might be \"snob,\" but that's more of an adjective. \"Elite\" is a noun, but the user wants synonyms for \"elitist,\" so \"elite\" might be acceptable. However, the user specified \"synonyms\" and maximum two, so I should check if \"elite\" is considered a synonym here.\n\nWait, \"elitist\" as a noun is someone who is elitist. So, \"elite\" as a noun is directly related. But maybe \"upper class\" is more specific. Let me confirm. \"Upper class\" is a group, while \"elitist\" is the person. So \"upper class\" might not be the best synonym. \n\nAlternatively, \"aristocrat\" is a noun that refers to someone from the upper class. So that's a possible synonym. \"Elite\" is also a noun, but it's more general. The user might accept both, but since they asked for maximum two, I should list them. \n\nSo the two synonyms would be \"elite\" and \"aristocrat\". But I need to make sure they are indeed synonyms. \"Elite\" is the group, and \"aristocrat\" is a member of that group. So \"aristocrat\" is a specific type of elite. Therefore, \"elite\" is a broader term. \n\nBut the user might consider \"aristocrat\" as a direct synonym. So the answer would be \"elite; aristocrat\". However, I should check if \"elite\" is considered a synonym here. Since \"elitist\" is the noun, \"elite\" is the noun form, so that's acceptable. \n\nTherefore, the two synonyms are \"elite\" and \"aristocrat\".\n...done thinking.\n\nelite; aristocrat"
