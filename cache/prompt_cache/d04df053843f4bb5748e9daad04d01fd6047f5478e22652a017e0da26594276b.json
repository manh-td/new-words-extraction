  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"elitist\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"elitist\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"elitist\" means. It refers to someone who belongs to an elite group and has a preference for the privileges and advantages of that group.\n\nNow, I need to think of other nouns that can replace \"elitist.\" Let me brainstorm. Words like \"elite\" are close, but that's an adjective. For a noun, maybe \"elite\" itself is a synonym. Then there's \"aristocrat,\" which refers to someone from a noble family, but it's more about social status. Another possibility is \"snob,\" which is an adjective, but maybe \"snob\" can be used as a noun. Wait, the user specified \"noun,\" so I need to make sure.\n\nAnother term could be \"upper class,\" but that's more general. \"Eccentrics\" might not fit exactly. \"Nobility\" is an adjective. \"Elite\" as a noun is acceptable. So the main synonyms would be \"elite\" and \"aristocrat.\" But I need to check if \"aristocrat\" is considered a synonym here. Sometimes \"aristocrat\" is used more specifically for those in the nobility, but it's a valid noun. \n\nSo the two synonyms would be \"elite\" and \"aristocrat.\" Let me confirm if there are others. \"Snob\" as a noun is possible, but it's more of an adjective in some contexts. So maybe \"elite\" and \"aristocrat\" are the best choices. I should present them as the answer, joined by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\nelite; aristocrat"
