  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"chastened\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user wants synonyms for \"chastened\" (an adjective). First, I need to recall what \"chastened\" means. It means to be humbled or to feel ashamed, often due to a mistake or wrongdoing. So synonyms would be words that convey similar feelings.\n\nI remember \"humiliated\" is a synonym. It's similar because both involve feeling ashamed. Then there's \"mortified,\" which also means to feel shame, especially in a public or social setting. Both are adjectives. Let me check if they are indeed synonyms. Yes, \"humiliated\" and \"mortified\" both describe the feeling of shame. So the answer should be those two, joined by a semicolon. I need to make sure there's no third word and that it's in plain text as requested.\n...done thinking.\n\nhumiliated; mortified"
