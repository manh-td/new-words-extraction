  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bohemian\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to provide two example sentences using the word \"bohemian\" as an adjective. Let me think of appropriate contexts.\n\nFirst, maybe something about artists. Bohemians are often associated with creative people. So, \"The bohemian artist painted vivid landscapes.\" That works. \n\nAnother example could be about a person who lives a free-spirited life. \"She's a bohemian who loves wandering through the city.\" That shows the lifestyle aspect. \n\nWait, I need to make sure the sentences are correct. \"Bohemian\" means someone who is non-conformist, so the second sentence should emphasize their free-spirited nature. \n\nI think those two sentences fit. Let me check if they're within the word limit and in the correct format. Yep, two sentences, no JSON or explanation. Alright, that should do it.\n...done thinking.\n\nThe bohemian painter inspired many with their unique style; the bohemian lifestyle embraces freedom and creativity."
