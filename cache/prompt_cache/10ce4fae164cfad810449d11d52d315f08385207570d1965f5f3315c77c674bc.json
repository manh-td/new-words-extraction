  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"eroded\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"eroded\" as a verb. Let me think. \"Eroded\" means to wear away or dissolve, right? So synonyms would be words that mean the same thing. Common ones might be \"weathered\" or \"worn away.\" Wait, \"weathered\" is more about being exposed to the elements, but it can also mean worn away. \"Worn\" is another option, but that's more general. \"Eroded\" is specifically about gradual wearing away. \"Corroded\" is another possibility, but that's more about rusting. So maybe \"weathered\" and \"worn away\" are the best synonyms here. Let me check if \"worn\" is considered a synonym. Hmm, \"worn\" is more about being used, but \"eroded\" is about being worn away. So maybe \"weathered\" and \"corroded\" are better. Wait, \"corroded\" is more specific to metals. So perhaps \"weathered\" and \"worn\" are the most accurate. But the user wants maximum two synonyms. So I'll go with \"weathered; worn.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nweathered; worn"
