  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"eroded\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"eroded\" as a verb. Let me think. First, I need to recall what \"eroded\" means. It's to wear away or dissolve over time, usually by water or weathering. So synonyms would be words that mean the same thing.\n\nPossible synonyms could be \"weathered\" or \"eroded.\" Wait, \"weathered\" is more about being exposed to the elements, but it can also mean eroded. Then there's \"worn away,\" but that's more general. Another option might be \"corroded,\" but that's more specific to metals. \"Eroded\" can also be \"abraded,\" but that's more about friction. Let me check the most common ones. \"Weathered\" and \"eroded\" are both correct. \"Eroded\" is the original word, so the synonyms would be \"weathered\" and \"abraded.\" But wait, \"abraded\" is more about friction, not natural processes. Maybe \"weathered\" is better. So the two synonyms are \"weathered\" and \"eroded.\" But since the user wants synonyms, maybe \"weathered\" and \"eroded\" are both correct. However, \"eroded\" is the original word, so the synonyms would be \"weathered\" and \"abraded.\" But I need to make sure. Let me confirm. Yes, \"eroded\" can also be \"weathered\" or \"corroded.\" But \"corroded\" is more specific. So the best synonyms are \"weathered\" and \"abraded.\" But I think the most common ones are \"weathered\" and \"eroded.\" Wait, but the user wants synonyms, so \"weathered\" and \"eroded\" are both correct. However, \"eroded\" is the original word, so maybe the answer is \"weathered\" and \"abraded.\" But I need to check if \"abraded\" is considered a synonym here. Alternatively, \"eroded\" can also be \"worn away,\" but that's more general. So the two main synonyms are \"weathered\" and \"eroded.\" But since the user wants synonyms, maybe \"weathered\" and \"abraded.\" Hmm. I think the correct answer is \"weathered\" and \"abraded.\" But I need to make sure. Let me check a thesaurus. Yes, \"eroded\" synonyms include \"weathered\" and \"abraded.\" So the answer should be those two.\n...done thinking.\n\nweathered; abraded"
