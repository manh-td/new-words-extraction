  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"groomed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"groomed\" as a verb. Let me think. First, I need to recall what \"groomed\" means. It's to prepare someone for a wedding, like training them or making them ready. So synonyms would be words that mean to prepare or train someone for a formal event.\n\nPossible synonyms could be \"trained\" or \"prepared\". Let me check if those are accurate. \"Trained\" fits because it's about teaching someone skills. \"Prepared\" is more general, but \"trained\" is more specific to the context of wedding preparation. Are there any others? Maybe \"trained\" and \"prepared\" are the main ones. I should make sure there's no other common synonym. Sometimes people might use \"shaped\" or \"tutor\", but those are less common. So the best answer is trained; prepared. But wait, the user wants maximum two synonyms. So I'll list them as trained; prepared.\n...done thinking.\n\ntrained; prepared"
