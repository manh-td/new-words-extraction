  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"groomed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"groomed\" as a verb. Let me think. \"Groomed\" means to take care of someone, like a horse or a person, to prepare them for an event. So synonyms could be words that mean to take care of or to prepare. Words like \"trained\" come to mind because training someone involves grooming them. Another one might be \"shaped,\" as in shaping a horse's appearance. Wait, \"shaped\" is more about forming, but \"trained\" is about teaching skills. Hmm, maybe \"trained\" is a better synonym. Let me check another angle. \"Groomed\" can also mean to prepare, so \"prepared\" is another option. But the user wants synonyms, so maybe \"trained\" and \"prepared\" are the best choices. Let me make sure they are valid. Yes, \"trained\" is a synonym, and \"prepared\" is also acceptable. So the answer should be \"trained; prepared\".\n...done thinking.\n\ntrained; prepared"
