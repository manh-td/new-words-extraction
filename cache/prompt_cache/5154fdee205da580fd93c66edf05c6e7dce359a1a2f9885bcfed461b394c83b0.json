  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"groomed\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"groomed\" as an adjective. Let me think. \"Groomed\" means to prepare someone for a wedding, like training them or making them ready. So synonyms would be words that mean preparing or preparing for a wedding.\n\nFirst, \"trimmed\" comes to mind. That's often used in the context of trimming hair, but it can also mean preparing something. Though \"trimmed\" is more about cutting, maybe it's a close synonym here. Then there's \"prepared.\" That's a more general term, but it fits because \"groomed\" is about preparing for a wedding.\n\nWait, are there other options? \"Tidied\" might be another one, but that's more about making something look neat. \"Tidied\" is more about cleanliness, while \"groomed\" is about preparation. So maybe \"trimmed\" and \"prepared\" are the best synonyms here. Let me check if \"trimmed\" is commonly used in this context. Yes, in some contexts, like trimming a groom's hair, it's used. So the two synonyms would be trimmed and prepared. I should present them as a string separated by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\ntrimmed; prepared"
