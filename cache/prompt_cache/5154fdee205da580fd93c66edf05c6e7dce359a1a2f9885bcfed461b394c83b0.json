  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"groomed\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"groomed\" as an adjective. Let me think. \"Groomed\" means to take care of someone, usually a bride, before a wedding. So synonyms would be words that mean to take care of or prepare someone.\n\nFirst, \"trained\" comes to mind because grooming can involve training. Then there's \"prepared,\" which directly means to prepare someone for an event. Are there any others? \"Tended\" might work, but \"tended\" is more about caring for something, like a plant. But the user specified \"adjective,\" so \"tended\" is an adjective. Wait, \"tended\" is more of a verb. Hmm.\n\nSo the best synonyms here are \"trained\" and \"prepared.\" Let me check if those are correct. Yes, \"trained\" is an adjective meaning prepared in advance, and \"prepared\" is also an adjective meaning ready. So the answer should be \"trained; prepared.\"\n...done thinking.\n\ntrained; prepared"
