  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"flounder\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for antonyms of \"flounder\" as a noun. Let me think. Flounder is a type of fish, right? So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of a fish. Common opposites for fish might include things like \"sand\" or \"water,\" but wait, those are more like environments. Maybe \"sand\" is a noun, but is it an antonym? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"sand\" is not the best. Let me consider other options. \"Sand\" is a noun, but does it directly oppose a fish? Not really. Maybe \"water\" is a better antonym, but that's a noun as well. Wait, the question specifies \"antonyms\" and the answer should be in plain text. So maybe the correct antonyms are \"sand\" and \"water\"? But I need to check if those are considered antonyms here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"sand\" is not the right choice. Let me think again. The word \"flounder\" is a type of fish, so antonyms would be things that aren't fish. But the user is asking for antonyms of \"flounder\" as a noun. So maybe \"sand\" and \"water\" are the antonyms. But I need to make sure. Another possibility is \"sand\" and \"water\" as antonyms. But I'm not sure. Maybe \"sand\" is more of a noun that's a type of environment, while \"water\" is another environment. So maybe the correct antonyms are \"sand\" and \"water\". But I should check if those are considered antonyms here. Alternatively, maybe \"sand\" is not the right answer. Let me think of other words. \"Flounder\" is a fish, so antonyms could be \"sand\" and \"water\", but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe \"sand\" is not the best. Maybe \"water\" is a better antonym. But I need to stick to the answer. So the answer would be \"sand; water\" as the antonyms. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe \"sand\" is not the right answer. Let me think again. The user is asking for antonyms of \"flounder\" as a noun. So the antonyms would be words that are not fish. So \"sand\" is not a fish, but \"water\" is also not a fish. So both are antonyms. So the answer would be \"sand; water\".\n...done thinking.\n\nsand; water"
