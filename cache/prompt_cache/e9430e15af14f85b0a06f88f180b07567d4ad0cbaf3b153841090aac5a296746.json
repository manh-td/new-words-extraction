  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"flounder\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for the antonyms of \"flounder\" (noun). Let me think. Flounder is a type of fish, right? So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. Common opposites for fish might be things like \"salmon\" (another fish), but that's not an antonym. Wait, maybe \"cod\"? No, that's a different fish. Wait, maybe \"tuna\"? No, that's a different type. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the user is thinking of the verb form, but the word given is \"flounder\" as a noun. So the antonyms would be words that are the opposite of a fish. But what's the opposite of a fish? Maybe \"mammal\"? No, that's not exactly it. Or \"reptile\"? Not quite. Maybe \"fish\" itself is the antonym, but that's the word given. So maybe the antonyms are \"cod\" and \"tuna\"? But those are specific types of fish. Alternatively, maybe \"salmon\" is another fish, but that's not an antonym. \n\nWait, maybe the user is looking for the antonyms in the sense of the opposite category. So if \"flounder\" is a fish, then the antonyms could be \"mammal\" or \"reptile\", but those are broader categories. However, the question says \"antonyms\" which usually are specific words. So maybe \"cod\" and \"tuna\" are the antonyms. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe \"eel\" is another fish, but that's not an antonym. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the opposite in terms of the word's meaning. If \"flounder\" is a type of fish, then the antonyms could be \"salmon\" (another fish) but that's not an antonym. Wait, maybe \"shark\" is an antonym? No, that's a different type. \n\nI think the correct antonyms here are \"cod\" and \"tuna\", but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe \"mammal\" and \"reptile\" are the antonyms. But that's more about the category. Since the user asked for antonyms, and the word is a noun, maybe the answer is \"cod; tuna\". But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe \"eel\" is an antonym, but that's not correct. \n\nHmm, I think the most accurate antonyms here would be \"cod\" and \"tuna\", even though they are specific types of fish. So the answer should be \"cod; tuna\".\n...done thinking.\n\ncod;tuna"
