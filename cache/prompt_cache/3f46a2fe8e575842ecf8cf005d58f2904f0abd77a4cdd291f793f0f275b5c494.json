  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"snub\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"snub\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Snub\" as a noun means to behave in a way that is rude or insulting, often by showing contempt or ignoring someone.\n\nNow, looking for synonyms. The most common ones I can think of are \"begrudge\" or \"disparage,\" but wait, those are more verbs. As a noun, maybe \"derision\" or \"insult\"? Let me check. \"Derision\" means the act of showing contempt, which fits. \"Insult\" is more general. Another possibility is \"contempt,\" but that's more of an adjective. \n\nWait, \"snub\" as a noun can also mean a slight or a rebuke. So maybe \"rebuttal\" or \"rebuke\"? But those are more formal. \"Rebuttal\" is a noun, meaning a response to an argument. \"Rebuke\" is a noun too, meaning a severe criticism. \n\nBut I need to make sure these are accurate. Let me verify. \"Snub\" as a noun can indeed mean a slight or a rebuke. So the synonyms would be \"rebuttal\" and \"rebuke.\" But I should check if those are commonly used. Alternatively, \"derision\" is a good synonym. \n\nWait, \"derision\" is more about the act of showing contempt, which is what \"snub\" implies. So \"derision\" and \"rebuttal\" or \"rebuke.\" But maybe \"insult\" is also a synonym. However, \"insult\" is more general. \n\nI think the best synonyms here are \"derision\" and \"rebuttal.\" But I need to confirm. Let me think again. \"Snub\" as a noun can also be \"a slight,\" so \"slight\" is a synonym. But the user wants synonyms for \"snub\" as a noun, so \"slight\" might be acceptable. However, \"slight\" is more of an adjective. \n\nAlternatively, \"rebuke\" is a noun meaning a severe criticism, which is similar to a snub. So maybe \"rebuke\" and \"derision.\" But I need to check if \"derision\" is considered a synonym. \n\nI think the most accurate synonyms are \"derision\" and \"rebuttal.\" But I'm not sure if \"rebuttal\" is the best. Maybe \"rebuke\" is more commonly used. Let me go with \"derision\" and \"rebuke\" as the synonyms.\n...done thinking.\n\nrebuke; derision"
