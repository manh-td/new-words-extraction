  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"tactile\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"tactile\" (an adjective). First, I need to make sure I understand what \"tactile\" means. It refers to something that can be felt, like touch or texture. So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite, like not able to feel.\n\nHmm, what are the common antonyms for tactile? Let me think. Words like \"inert\" come to mind because something inert isn't able to feel. Another one might be \"abstract,\" but that's more about being non-physical. Wait, \"abstract\" isn't exactly the opposite in terms of sensory perception. Maybe \"intangible\"? No, that's more about being unable to be held. \n\nOh, \"inert\" seems right. Another possible antonym could be \"mechanical,\" but that's more about being machine-like. Or \"digital\"? Not sure. Wait, \"inert\" is a direct antonym. \"Abstract\" might not be the best fit. Let me check again. \n\nTactile means related to touch. So antonyms would be things that aren't related to touch. \"Inert\" is about not being able to feel, which fits. \"Abstract\" is more about not being concrete. Maybe \"digital\" is also a contender, but I think \"inert\" is more accurate. So the answer should be \"inert;\" maybe another one? Wait, \"mechanical\" could work if it's about not being able to feel, but I'm not sure. The user asked for maximum two, so maybe \"inert\" and \"mechanical\"? But I need to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, \"non-tactile\" is a phrase, but the user wants antonyms as standalone words. So \"inert\" is the primary antonym. Another possible is \"mechanical,\" but I'm not sure. Maybe the best answer is \"inert;\" another could be \"mechanical.\" But I need to check if \"mechanical\" is considered an antonym here. \n\nWait, \"mechanical\" is more about being machine-like, not necessarily about feeling. So maybe \"inert\" is the main one. The user might expect \"inert\" and \"abstract,\" but I'm not sure. To be safe, I'll go with \"inert\" and \"mechanical\" as the antonyms, but I need to verify. \n\nAlternatively, \"non-tactile\" is a phrase, but the user wants words. So \"inert\" is the best fit. Another possible is \"abstract,\" but I think \"inert\" is the main one. So the answer is \"inert;\" maybe another? Wait, \"mechanical\" could be considered an antonym if it's about not being able to feel. But I'm not sure. The user might expect \"inert\" and \"mechanical.\" But I need to make sure. \n\nIn conclusion, the antonyms are \"inert\" and \"mechanical.\" But I should check if \"mechanical\" is correct. Alternatively, \"abstract\" might be a better fit. Hmm. Maybe the correct antonyms are \"inert\" and \"mechanical.\" So the answer is \"inert;mechanical.\"\n...done thinking.\n\ninert;mechanical"
