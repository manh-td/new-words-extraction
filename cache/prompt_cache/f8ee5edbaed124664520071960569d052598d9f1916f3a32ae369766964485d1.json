  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"daemon\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to provide two example sentences using the word \"daemon\" as a noun. Let me think about common contexts where daemons are used. Daemons are often associated with operating systems, like in Unix or Linux, where they're background processes. So maybe something like \"The system administrator configured a daemon to monitor system performance.\" Another example could be in a creative context, like a magical creature in a story. Wait, the user specified \"noun,\" so I need to make sure the sentences use it as a noun. Maybe \"The ancient myth tells of a daemon that guards the gates of the underworld.\" That works. Let me check if those sentences are correct and fit the noun usage. Yes, \"daemon\" as a noun refers to a background process or a magical creature. Alright, that should do it.\n...done thinking.\n\ndaemon; the system administrator configured a daemon to monitor system performance; the ancient myth tells of a daemon that guards the gates of the underworld"
