  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"daemon\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences using the word \"daemon\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. A daemon is a supernatural being, often associated with gods or spirits in mythology. So, the examples should reflect that.\n\nThe user specified maximum two sentences. Let me come up with two sentences. The first one could be about a daemon in a story. Like, \"In the ancient myth, there was a daemon that guarded the kingdom.\" Then the second one might be about a modern context, maybe a computer daemon. \"The system's daemon ran silently in the background.\" That should cover both ancient and modern uses. I need to check if the sentences are correct and fit the noun usage. Yep, \"daemon\" as a noun is used here. No JSON, just the sentences in the required format.\n...done thinking.\n\ndaemon; a supernatural being in ancient mythology; the creature served by a god in Norse mythology  \ndaemon; a computer process that runs automatically in operating systems"
