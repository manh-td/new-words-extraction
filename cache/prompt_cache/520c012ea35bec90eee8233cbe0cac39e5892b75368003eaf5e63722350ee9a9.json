  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"innate\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"innate\" (adjective). Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"innate\" means. It refers to something that is present from birth or inherent, not learned. So antonyms would be things that are not inherent, learned, or not natural.\n\nWhat comes to mind? Words like \"acquired\" come to mind because they mean something you learn over time. Then there's \"learned,\" which is directly opposite. Another possible antonym could be \"acquired,\" but maybe \"acquired\" is more about something that's gained through learning. Wait, \"innate\" is about something that's inherent, so \"acquired\" would be the opposite. But maybe \"learned\" is more precise. Let me check.\n\nIn dictionary terms, \"acquired\" is an adjective meaning something that is gained through learning or experience. \"Learned\" is an adjective meaning something that has been learned. Both are antonyms, but \"acquired\" might be more about the process of gaining, while \"learned\" is about the state. However, in the context of the word \"innate,\" which is about something that is inherent, the antonyms would be things that are not inherent. So \"acquired\" and \"learned\" both fit. But the user wants antonyms, so maybe \"acquired\" and \"learned\" are the two. But I need to check if there are others.\n\nAnother possible antonym is \"natural,\" but that's a bit different. \"Natural\" can mean something that exists in nature, but \"innate\" is more about being inherent. So \"natural\" might not be the best antonym here. Let me confirm. \"Innate\" vs. \"acquired\" vs. \"learned.\" Yes, \"acquired\" and \"learned\" are direct antonyms. So the answer should be \"acquired; learned\".\n...done thinking.\n\nacquired; learned"
