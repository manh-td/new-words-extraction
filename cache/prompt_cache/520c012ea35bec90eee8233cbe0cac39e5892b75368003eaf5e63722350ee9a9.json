  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"innate\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for antonyms of the word \"innate\" (adjective). First, I need to make sure I understand what \"innate\" means. It refers to something that is present from birth or inherent, not learned. So antonyms would be things that are not inherent, learned, or not natural.\n\nThinking about synonyms first might help. The main antonyms could be \"acquired\" or \"learned\". But the user specifically wants antonyms, so I need to focus on words that contrast with \"innate\". \n\n\"Acquired\" is a good one because it means something you gain over time, not something you're born with. Then there's \"learned\", which is similar. But maybe \"natural\" is also a contender? Wait, \"natural\" is more about something occurring in nature, but \"innate\" is about something inherent. Hmm, maybe \"natural\" is not the best antonym here. \n\nAnother possibility is \"acquired\" and \"learned\". But the user wants antonyms, so I need to check if these are correct. \"Acquired\" is an antonym, and \"learned\" is also an antonym. However, \"learned\" is more about the process of learning, while \"acquired\" is about gaining through experience. Both are valid antonyms. \n\nWait, but the user said \"maximum 2\" antonyms. So I can list both. Let me confirm. Yes, \"acquired\" and \"learned\" are both antonyms. So the answer should be \"acquired; learned\".\n...done thinking.\n\nacquired; learned"
