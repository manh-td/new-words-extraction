  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"contemporary\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of \"contemporary\" as a noun. Let me think. Contemporary means related to the present or modern times. So, synonyms could be things like \"modern\" or \"current\". Wait, but they specified \"noun\" so I need to make sure both are nouns. \"Modern\" is a noun, like \"a modern approach\". \"Current\" is also a noun, like \"current events\". But I should check if those are considered synonyms here. Maybe \"modern\" is more direct. Alternatively, \"up-to-date\" could work, but that's more of an adjective. So the best synonyms would be \"modern\" and \"current\". Let me confirm. Yes, both are nouns and mean something related to the present. So the answer should be \"modern; current\".\n...done thinking.\n\nmodern; current"
