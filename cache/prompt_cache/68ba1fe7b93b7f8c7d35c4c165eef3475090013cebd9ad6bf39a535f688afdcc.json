  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"contemporary\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of \"contemporary\" as a noun. Let me think. Contemporary means related to the present or recent times. So synonyms could be things like modern, current, up-to-date, or recent. But since they specified \"noun,\" I need to make sure those words are nouns. \"Modern\" is a noun, \"current\" is also a noun, \"up-to-date\" is an adjective, so maybe \"recent\" is better as a noun. Wait, \"recent\" as a noun can mean the latest events or things. So possible synonyms are modern, current, recent. But the user wants maximum two. Let me check again. \"Modern\" and \"current\" are both common nouns. \"Recent\" is also a noun. So maybe two of them. But the user might expect two. So the answer would be modern; current. Or maybe modern; recent. Need to pick the best two. \"Modern\" is more general, \"recent\" is more specific. Either way, both are valid. So the answer is modern; current.\n...done thinking.\n\nmodern; current"
