  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"emanates\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user wants synonyms for \"emanates\" as a verb. First, I need to recall what \"emanates\" means. It's to emit or produce something, like a scent or a sound. So synonyms would be words that mean the same thing.\n\nI remember \"exudes\" is a common synonym. It means to emit or show something, like a scent. Then there's \"issues,\" which can mean to produce something, like a problem or a statement. But wait, \"issues\" is more about problems, not necessarily the same as emitting. Hmm.\n\nAnother one might be \"spreads,\" but that's more about spreading something. \"Spreads\" can be a synonym, but maybe \"exudes\" is more accurate. Let me check. \"Emanates\" is more about the act of emitting, so \"exudes\" fits better. \"Issues\" is more about producing problems, so maybe \"issues\" is not the best. \n\nWait, \"issues\" can also mean to produce something, like a problem, but in the context of emitting, maybe \"issues\" is acceptable. But I think \"exudes\" is a more direct synonym. So the two synonyms would be \"exudes\" and \"issues.\" But I need to make sure. Let me think again. \"Emanates\" is to emit, so \"exudes\" is correct. \"Issues\" is more about producing problems, but in some contexts, it can mean to produce something. So maybe both are acceptable. But the user asked for synonyms, so both are valid. So the answer would be \"exudes; issues\".\n...done thinking.\n\nexudes; issues"
