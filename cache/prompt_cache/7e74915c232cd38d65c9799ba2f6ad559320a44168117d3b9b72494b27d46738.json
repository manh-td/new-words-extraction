  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"menial\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"menial\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what a menial is. From what I know, a menial is someone who does menial tasks, usually considered lowly or servant-like. So, the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of a servant or someone who does menial work.\n\nThinking about synonyms for menial, words like \"servant\" come to mind. But the user specifically asked for antonyms, so \"servant\" is a good one. Another possible antonym could be \"freeman,\" but that's more about being free rather than serving. \"Servant\" seems more direct. Wait, are there other options? \"Wretch\" is a strong term, but maybe too extreme. \"Slave\" is another possible antonym, but that's more about being forced. \n\nSo the main antonyms here are \"servant\" and \"freeman.\" But I need to check if \"freeman\" is considered an antonym in this context. Sometimes \"freeman\" can mean someone who is free, but in the context of menial tasks, it might not fit as directly. \"Servant\" is more accurate. So the answer should be \"servant;\" maybe \"freeman\" as well. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, \"freeman\" might not be the best fit. Maybe \"freeman\" is more about being free, whereas \"servant\" is about serving. So the correct antonyms are \"servant\" and \"freeman.\" But I should confirm if \"freeman\" is considered an antonym here. Alternatively, maybe \"freeman\" isn't the best. Let me think again. The word \"menial\" is a noun, so the antonyms would be nouns. \"Servant\" is a noun. \"Freeman\" is also a noun. So both are valid antonyms. Therefore, the answer should be \"servant; freeman.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nservant; freeman"
