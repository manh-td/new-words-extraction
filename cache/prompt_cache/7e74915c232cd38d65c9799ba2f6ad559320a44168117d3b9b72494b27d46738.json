  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"menial\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user wants the antonyms of the word \"menial\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what a menial is. From what I know, a menial is someone who does menial tasks, usually considered low-level or servant-like work. So, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of a menial.\n\nThe word \"menial\" comes from Latin, meaning a servant or a low-ranking worker. So, antonyms would be things like \"master,\" \"boss,\" \"employer,\" or \"employer.\" But since the user specified \"noun,\" I need to check if those are nouns. \"Master\" is a noun, \"boss\" is also a noun, and \"employer\" is a noun. However, \"employer\" might be more general. \n\nWait, the user said \"maximum 2\" antonyms. So maybe two best ones. \"Master\" and \"boss\" are both common antonyms. But I should check if they are indeed nouns. Yes, both are nouns. Alternatively, \"employer\" is also a noun. But the user might expect more common words. \n\nAnother possibility is \"servant,\" but that's more directly related to the original meaning. However, the user might prefer more common antonyms. So between \"master\" and \"boss,\" either would work. Alternatively, \"employer\" is a good antonym. But since the user wants maximum 2, maybe \"master\" and \"boss\" are the best choices. Let me confirm. \n\nYes, \"master\" and \"boss\" are direct antonyms. So the answer should be \"master; boss\".\n...done thinking.\n\nmaster; boss"
