  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"provincials\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants antonyms for \"provincials\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"provincials\" means. From context, it's probably referring to people from provinces, like provincial people or provincial officials. So antonyms would be things like \"urbanites\" (people from cities) or \"nationals\" (people from the country as a whole). Wait, but \"nationals\" might be a bit more general. Let me check if there's a more precise antonym. Maybe \"urbanites\" is better because it's specifically about people from cities opposed to those from provinces. So the two antonyms would be urbanites and nationals. I should make sure they're correct and separate them with semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\nurbanites;nationals"
