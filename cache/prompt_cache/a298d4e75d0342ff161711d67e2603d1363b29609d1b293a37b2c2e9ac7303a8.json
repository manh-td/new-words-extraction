  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"provincials\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants antonyms for \"provincials\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"provincials\" means. From context, it's likely referring to people from a province or regions. So antonyms would be things like \"urbanites\" (people from cities) or \"ruralites\" (people from rural areas). But wait, \"ruralites\" might not be a standard term. Maybe \"urbanites\" is more common. Let me check. Yes, \"urbanites\" is a recognized antonym for provincials. Another possible one could be \"city-dwellers,\" but that's more general. Since the user asked for maximum two, and \"urbanites\" is a clear antonym, I'll go with that. Maybe \"city-dwellers\" as another, but I need to confirm if that's acceptable. However, \"urbanites\" is more specific. So the answer should be \"urbanites; city-dwellers\". But wait, the user said maximum two, so both are acceptable. Let me make sure there's no better term. \"Ruralites\" might be considered, but it's less common. So the safest answer is \"urbanites; city-dwellers\".\n...done thinking.\n\nurbanites; city-dwellers"
