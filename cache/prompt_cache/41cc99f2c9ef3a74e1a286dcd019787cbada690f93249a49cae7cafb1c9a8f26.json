  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"groomed\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to create two example sentences using the word \"groomed\" as a verb. Let me think about how to use it correctly.\n\nFirst, \"groomed\" means to train or teach, especially in a professional setting. So maybe something like a trainer grooming a dog. That's a common scenario. Then, another example could be a coach grooming a player for a competition. Both sentences use the verb in a typical context.\n\nWait, I should make sure the sentences are correct. \"Groomed\" is past tense, so the sentences should be in past tense. Let me check the examples again. Yes, both sentences use the past tense. Also, the second sentence could be more specific, like \"the coach groomed the player for the tournament.\" That sounds good.\n\nI think that's it. Two sentences, each using \"groomed\" in the past tense, in different contexts. No need for any extra information since the user asked for just the sentences.\n...done thinking.\n\ngroomed a dog for a show; the coach groomed the player for the tournament"
