  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"palatable\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of \"palatable\" (an adjective). Let me think. Palatable means something that is pleasant to the taste, so antonyms would be things that are not pleasant. Words like disgusting, unpleasant, or aversive come to mind. But I need to make sure they are correct.\n\nWait, \"disgusting\" is an adjective, but maybe \"unpalatable\" is the direct antonym. However, the question is about antonyms of \"palatable,\" so \"unpalatable\" is the opposite. But the user wants antonyms, so maybe \"unpalatable\" is the primary one. Then, are there others? \"Disgusting\" could be a synonym for unpalatable, but maybe \"unpalatable\" is more precise. \n\nAnother possible antonym is \"averse,\" but that's more about being unwilling rather than taste. So the main antonym here is \"unpalatable.\" But the user asked for maximum two, so maybe \"unpalatable\" and \"disgusting\"? But I need to check if \"disgusting\" is considered an antonym here. \n\nAlternatively, \"unpalatable\" is the direct antonym, and \"disgusting\" is a related term. But maybe the user wants the most direct antonym. So the answer would be \"unpalatable\" and \"disgusting\"? But I need to confirm. \n\nWait, \"disgusting\" is an adjective, but it's more about the quality of being repulsive, not necessarily about taste. So maybe \"unpalatable\" is the best answer. But the user might expect \"disgusting\" as well. Hmm. \n\nI think the correct antonyms are \"unpalatable\" and \"disgusting.\" But I should check if \"disgusting\" is considered an antonym here. Since \"unpalatable\" is the direct opposite, and \"disgusting\" is a related term, but maybe the primary antonym is \"unpalatable.\" However, the user might accept both. So the answer would be \"unpalatable; disgusting.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nunpalatable; disgusting"
