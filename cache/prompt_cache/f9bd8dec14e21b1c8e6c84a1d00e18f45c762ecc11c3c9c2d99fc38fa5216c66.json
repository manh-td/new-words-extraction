  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"palatable\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user wants the antonyms of \"palatable\" (an adjective). Let me think. Palatable means something that is pleasant to the taste, so antonyms would be things that are not pleasant. Words like \"inexpalatable\" come to mind, but that's a less common word. Maybe \"unpalatable\" is the direct antonym. Another one could be \"averse\" which means not wanting to taste something. Wait, but \"averse\" is more about unwillingness rather than taste. So the main antonym here is \"unpalatable\". Then there's \"inexpalatable\", but that's not commonly used. So the best answer is \"unpalatable\" and maybe \"inexpalatable\" if allowed. But since the user asked for maximum 2 and they want antonyms, I should list both. But I need to check if \"inexpalatable\" is a valid antonym. Maybe it's a less common variant. So the answer would be \"unpalatable; inexpalatable\".\n...done thinking.\n\nunpalatable; inexpalatable"
