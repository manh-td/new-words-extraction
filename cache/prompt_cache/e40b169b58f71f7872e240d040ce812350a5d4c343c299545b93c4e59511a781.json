  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"maneuvers\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the word \"maneuvers\" as a verb. Let me start by recalling the meaning of the word. \"Maneuvers\" means to move or handle something skillfully, often in a military or tactical context.\n\nFirst, I need to think of scenarios where someone is performing maneuvers. Maybe in a military context? Like a soldier practicing moves. So, \"The soldier practiced precise maneuvers during the drill.\" That sounds good. \n\nAnother example could be in a sports context, like a football player moving around the field. So, \"The quarterback executed flawless maneuvers to evade the defender.\" That works too. \n\nI should check if these sentences are correct and fit the verb form. \"Maneuvers\" is indeed a verb, so both sentences use it correctly. Also, the sentences are short and clear. I don't need to add any extra information, just the two sentences. Alright, that should be it.\n...done thinking.\n\nsoldier practiced precise maneuvers during the drill; quarterback executed flawless maneuvers to evade the defender"
