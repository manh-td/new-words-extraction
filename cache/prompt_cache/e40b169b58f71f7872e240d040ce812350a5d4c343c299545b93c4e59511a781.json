  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"maneuvers\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences for the verb \"maneuvers\". Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Maneuver\" as a verb means to move carefully and skillfully, often in a delicate or complex way. So, possible sentences could involve moving in a specific context.\n\nMaybe something like \"The pilot performed a precise maneuver to avoid the storm.\" That shows skill and purpose. Another example could be \"She maneuvered the car into the parking spot smoothly.\" Here, it's about controlling movement. I need to check if these are correct and fit the verb. Also, ensure the sentences are short and only use the word once each. Alright, that should work.\n...done thinking.\n\nmaneuvered the ship through the narrow canal; the pilot executed a precise maneuver to avoid the storm."
