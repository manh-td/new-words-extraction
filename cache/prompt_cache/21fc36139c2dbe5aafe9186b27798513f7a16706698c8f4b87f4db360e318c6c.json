  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"culminating\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to create two example sentences using the word \"culminating\" as a verb. Let me think about the correct contexts.\n\nFirst, \"culminating\" means reaching a peak or final stage. So, maybe something like a project that's getting to the end. Like, \"The project was culminating in a successful launch.\" That sounds good.\n\nAnother example could be something that's building up to a climax. Maybe \"The festival was culminating in a grand finale, drawing crowds from all over.\" That works too. \n\nI need to check if these sentences are correct and natural. The first one mentions a project reaching its peak, the second talks about a festival ending in a grand finale. Both use \"culminating\" correctly. \n\nI should make sure not to use any markdown and keep it simple. So the answer would be those two sentences in the specified format.\n...done thinking.\n\nsentence 1; sentence 2"
