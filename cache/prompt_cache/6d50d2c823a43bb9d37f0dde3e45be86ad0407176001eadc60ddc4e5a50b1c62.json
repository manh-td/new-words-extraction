  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"grain\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user asked for antonyms of the word \"grain\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what they're asking for. They want words that mean the opposite of \"grain\" in the noun form.\n\nSo, \"grain\" can refer to the seeds of plants, like in grains like wheat or rice. The antonyms would be words that mean something not related to grains. But wait, the question is about antonyms, so I need to think of words that are directly opposite in meaning.\n\nPossible antonyms could be things like \"flour\" (since grain is the raw material, flour is the processed form), but that's more of a related term. Maybe \"seed\" is a synonym, so that's not an antonym. What about \"grain\" itself? No, that's the word. \n\nAnother angle: in some contexts, \"grain\" could mean something like \"grain\" as in \"grain of sand\" or \"grain of salt,\" but those are specific instances. The general antonyms would be things like \"dust,\" \"sand,\" \"powder,\" but those are more about the texture or state. \n\nWait, the user specified \"antonyms\" so I need to pick the most accurate ones. In dictionary terms, the direct antonyms might be \"flour\" (as in the processed form) and \"seed\" (as in the raw material). But \"seed\" is a synonym, so that's not an antonym. \n\nAlternatively, \"grain\" can also mean \"grain of sand\" or \"grain of salt,\" but those are specific cases. The general antonyms would be \"dust\" and \"sand,\" but those are more about the state. \n\nWait, maybe \"grain\" as in \"grain\" as in the plant's seeds, so the antonyms would be \"kernel\" (as in the part of the plant that's edible), but that's a synonym. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think again. The primary antonyms for \"grain\" as a noun (the seeds) would be \"kernel\" (as in the part of the plant that's edible), but that's a synonym. Alternatively, \"flour\" is the processed form, so that's a related term. \n\nBut the question is about antonyms, so maybe \"flour\" and \"seed\" are the antonyms? Wait, \"seed\" is a synonym. So maybe \"flour\" is the only antonym. \n\nAlternatively, \"grain\" can also mean \"grain of sand,\" so the antonym would be \"dust.\" But that's a specific case. \n\nIn standard dictionaries, the antonyms for \"grain\" as a noun (the seeds) would be \"kernel\" (as in the part of the plant that's edible), but that's a synonym. So maybe there's no direct antonym. But the user is asking for antonyms, so perhaps the answer is \"flour\" and \"seed,\" but \"seed\" is a synonym. \n\nWait, maybe the user is thinking of \"grain\" as in the plant's seeds, so the antonyms would be \"kernel\" (as in the part of the plant that's edible) and \"dust\" (as in the fine powder). But \"kernel\" is a synonym. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the answer is \"flour\" and \"dust,\" but I need to check if those are considered antonyms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is just \"flour\" because that's the processed form. But I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that, the most accurate antonyms would be \"flour\" and \"dust.\" But since \"dust\" is more about the state, maybe \"flour\" is the main antonym. \n\nWait, the user said \"maximum 2\" antonyms. So perhaps the answer is \"flour\" and \"seed,\" but \"seed\" is a synonym. So maybe only \"flour\" is the antonym. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"grain\" as in the plant's seeds, so the antonyms would be \"kernel\" (as in the part of the plant that's edible) and \"dust.\" But \"kernel\" is a synonym. \n\nI think the correct antonyms here are \"flour\" and \"dust.\" But since \"dust\" is more about the state, maybe \"flour\" is the main one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is just \"flour\" because that's the processed form. \n\nI think the answer is \"flour\" and \"dust,\" but I'm not 100% sure. However, since the user wants antonyms, and \"dust\" is a possible antonym, I'll go with \"flour; dust.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nflour;dust"
