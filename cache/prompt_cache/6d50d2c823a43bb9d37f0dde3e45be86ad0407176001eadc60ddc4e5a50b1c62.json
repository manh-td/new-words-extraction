  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"grain\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for antonyms of \"grain\" as a noun. Let me think. Grain is a noun that refers to the seeds of plants, like wheat or rice. The antonyms would be things that are not seeds. So words like \"plant\" or \"seed\" come to mind. Wait, but \"plant\" is a noun too. However, the question is about antonyms of \"grain\" specifically. So maybe \"plant\" is a better antonym because it's the opposite in meaning. Then there's \"seed,\" but that's part of the definition of grain. So maybe \"plant\" is the main antonym. Are there others? \"Kernel\" is a part of a grain, but that's more specific. \"Kernel\" is a noun, but maybe not as direct an antonym. So the best antonyms would be \"plant\" and \"seed.\" But since the user wants maximum 2, and they need to be joined by semicolons. So the answer would be \"plant; seed\".\n...done thinking.\n\nplant; seed"
