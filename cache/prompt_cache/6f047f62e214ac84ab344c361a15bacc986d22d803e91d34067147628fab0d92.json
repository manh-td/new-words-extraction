  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"daemon\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"daemon\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand what a daemon is. From what I remember, a daemon in computing is a program that runs in the background, often with limited privileges. But as a noun, it's more abstract. Antonyms would be words that contrast with it.\n\nHmm, the word \"daemon\" is related to something that's in the background, maybe something that's not visible or active. So antonyms could be things that are active, visible, or more prominent. Words like \"process\" come to mind, but that's more of a general term. Maybe \"process\" is too broad. What about \"task\"? That's more specific. Or \"program\"? But \"program\" is a bit more general.\n\nWait, the user wants antonyms. So I need to find words that are opposites. \"Daemon\" is a background process, so antonyms might be things that are not in the background, like \"foreground\" or \"active\". But \"foreground\" is an adjective. Maybe \"foreground\" is too specific. Alternatively, \"process\" as a noun. But \"process\" can be a synonym. Wait, maybe \"process\" is not an antonym. Let me think again.\n\nAnother angle: \"daemon\" is a type of process, so antonyms could be \"task\" or \"program\". But \"task\" is more of a general term. \"Process\" is a synonym. So maybe \"task\" is better. Or \"program\" as a noun. But \"program\" is more of a general term. \n\nWait, the user wants antonyms. So if \"daemon\" is a background process, then antonyms would be things that are not in the background. So \"foreground\" is an adjective, but maybe \"foreground\" is not a word they're looking for. Alternatively, \"active\" as an adjective. But the user wants antonyms as nouns. \n\nHmm, maybe \"process\" is the best antonym here. Because a daemon is a process, so the antonym would be another process. But that's not exactly an antonym. Wait, maybe \"task\" is better. A task is something that is performed, whereas a daemon is a background process. So \"task\" could be an antonym. \n\nAlternatively, \"program\" as a noun. But \"program\" is more general. So maybe \"task\" and \"program\" are the antonyms. But I need to check if those are correct. \n\nWait, in the context of computing, a daemon is a background process. So antonyms could be \"foreground\" (as an adjective), but since the user wants nouns, maybe \"foreground\" isn't acceptable. Alternatively, \"process\" as a noun. But \"process\" is a synonym. \n\nI think the most accurate antonyms here would be \"task\" and \"program\". But I need to confirm. Let me think of other possibilities. \"Foreground\" is an adjective, but maybe \"foreground\" is not a noun. So perhaps \"task\" and \"program\" are the best antonyms. \n\nSo the answer would be \"task; program\". But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe \"process\" is considered an antonym. But I think \"task\" and \"program\" are more accurate. \n\nTherefore, the antonyms are \"task; program\".\n...done thinking.\n\ntask; program"
