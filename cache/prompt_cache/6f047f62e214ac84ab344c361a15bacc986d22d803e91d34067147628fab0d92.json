  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"daemon\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user wants the antonyms of the word \"daemon\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand what a daemon is. From what I recall, a daemon in computing is a program that runs in the background, often with limited privileges. But the user is asking for antonyms, so words that mean the opposite of a daemon.\n\nHmm, the primary antonym of \"daemon\" in a technical context might be something like \"process\" or \"program.\" But wait, \"process\" is more general. Let me think of other terms. There's also \"service,\" but that's more about a service in a system. \"Service\" might be a bit broader. \n\nAnother angle: in mythology, a daemon is a supernatural being. So antonyms might be things like \"spirit\" or \"spiritual entity.\" But \"spirit\" is more general. \n\nWait, the user specified \"noun,\" so maybe \"process\" is more appropriate here. \"Service\" could also be a noun, but I'm not sure if that's the best antonym. Let me check. \n\nIn computing, a daemon is a background process. So the antonym would be a process that is not in the background, maybe a foreground process. But \"foreground\" is an adjective. \n\nAlternatively, \"program\" is a noun, but that's more about the code. Maybe \"program\" is a better antonym. \n\nWait, but the user wants antonyms for \"daemon\" as a noun. So the most direct antonyms would be \"process\" and \"service.\" But I need to make sure. \n\nAnother thought: in some contexts, \"daemon\" could be replaced by \"service,\" but I'm not sure. Let me think of standard antonyms. \n\nI think the best antonyms here are \"process\" and \"service.\" So joining them with a semicolon. \n\nWait, but maybe \"service\" is not the best. Let me confirm. If \"daemon\" is a background process, then the antonym would be a process that is not in the background, but \"foreground\" is an adjective. So maybe \"program\" is better. \n\nAlternatively, \"service\" as a noun could be the antonym. But I'm not sure. \n\nHmm, maybe the correct antonyms are \"process\" and \"service.\" So the answer would be \"process; service.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nprocess; service"
