  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"uncanny\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"uncanny\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to recall what \"uncanny\" means. It's an adjective, right? Like something that's strange or eerie, but the user specified it's a noun. Wait, is \"uncanny\" actually a noun? Let me double-check. Hmm, I think \"uncanny\" is more commonly an adjective. But maybe in some contexts, it can be a noun. For example, \"an uncanny experience\" – here, \"uncanny\" is an adjective modifying \"experience.\"\n\nBut the user provided the word as a noun, so maybe they're considering it in a different context. However, the standard definition is adjective. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but I should go with the given word. If it's a noun, what are the synonyms? Maybe \"strange\" or \"eerie\"? But I need to make sure. Let me think of other synonyms. \"Unusual\" could work, but that's more about being different. \"Strange\" is closer. \"Eerie\" is also a synonym. So the best synonyms would be \"strange\" and \"eerie.\" But since the user wants maximum 2, and they want them joined by semicolons. So the answer would be \"strange; eerie\".\n...done thinking.\n\nstrange; eerie"
