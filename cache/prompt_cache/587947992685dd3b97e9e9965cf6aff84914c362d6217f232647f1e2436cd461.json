  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"uncanny\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"uncanny\" as a noun. Let me think. Uncanny means strange or eerie, often in a supernatural way. So synonyms could be things that evoke a sense of strangeness. Words like \"strange\" come to mind, but maybe more specific. \"Eerie\" is a good one, as it's similar in meaning. Another possibility is \"marvelous,\" but that's more positive. \"Unusual\" is also close, but maybe not as precise. Let me check if \"eerie\" is considered a synonym here. Yes, it fits. \"Strange\" is a common synonym. So the two would be \"eerie\" and \"strange\". Wait, the user wants nouns. Are those nouns? \"Eerie\" is an adjective, but maybe in this context, it's acceptable. Alternatively, \"strange\" is also an adjective. Hmm. The original word is a noun, so maybe the synonyms should also be nouns. But \"eerie\" and \"strange\" are adjectives. Maybe the user is okay with that. Alternatively, \"mysterious\" is a noun, but that's more about mystery. \"Unusual\" as a noun? Not sure. Maybe \"strange\" is the best fit. So the answer would be \"strange; eerie\". Let me make sure there are only two. Yes, that's two. So the final answer is those two.\n...done thinking.\n\nstrange; eerie"
