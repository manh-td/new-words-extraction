  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"notary\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"notary\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to recall what a notary is. A notary public is someone who authenticates documents, right? So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of a notary.\n\nHmm, what's the opposite of a notary? Well, a notary is a public official, so maybe someone who is not a public official? Like a regular person? But wait, the question is about antonyms in the context of the word \"notary\" as a noun. So maybe the antonyms are people who are not public officials. But the user wants antonyms, so maybe words like \"common man\" or \"ordinary person\"? But that might be too broad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the antonym is \"agent\" because a notary is an agent who authenticates documents. But \"agent\" is more about representing someone else. Wait, but the user is asking for antonyms of \"notary\" as a noun. So maybe \"agent\" is not the best antonym here.\n\nAnother thought: \"notary\" is a public official, so the antonym could be \"common person\" or \"ordinary individual\". But I need to check if those are considered antonyms. Alternatively, maybe \"agent\" is considered an antonym in some contexts. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe the antonyms are \"agent\" and \"attorney\"? But that's not exactly opposite. A notary is a type of agent, but an attorney is a legal professional. So maybe \"attorney\" is not the antonym. \n\nAlternatively, \"notary\" is a public official, so the antonym could be \"common person\" or \"ordinary individual\". But I need to make sure. The user wants maximum two antonyms. So maybe \"agent\" and \"common person\"? But I'm not sure if \"agent\" is the correct antonym. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"notary\" is a specific role, so the antonym could be \"common person\" or \"ordinary individual\". But I need to confirm. \n\nWait, another angle: the antonym of \"notary\" as a noun could be \"agent\" because a notary is an agent who authenticates documents. But \"agent\" is more about representing someone else. So maybe \"agent\" is not the best antonym. \n\nAlternatively, \"notary\" is a public official, so the antonym could be \"common person\" or \"ordinary individual\". But I'm not sure if that's considered an antonym. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"notary\" is a noun, so the antonym could be \"common person\" or \"ordinary individual\". But I need to check if those are standard antonyms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"notary\" is a noun, so the antonym is \"common person\" or \"ordinary individual\". But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe the antonyms are \"agent\" and \"common person\". But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the antonyms are \"agent\" and \"common person\". But I need to make sure. \n\nI think the best antonyms here are \"agent\" and \"common person\". So the answer would be \"agent; common person\".\n...done thinking.\n\nagent; common person"
