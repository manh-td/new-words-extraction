  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"notary\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user wants the antonyms of the word \"notary\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to recall what a notary is. A notary public is someone who authenticates documents, right? So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of a notary.\n\nHmm, what's the opposite of a notary? Well, a notary is a public official, so maybe someone who is not a public official? Like a private individual? But wait, the question specifies \"antonyms\" for the noun. So maybe the antonym is someone who isn't a notary, but that's a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the antonym is \"commoner\" or \"ordinary person,\" but that's more about status than the role. Wait, the word \"notary\" is a professional, so the antonym could be \"commoner\" or \"layperson.\" But I need to make sure. Another thought: \"notary\" is a legal professional, so the antonym might be someone who isn't a legal professional, like a \"layperson\" or \"commoner.\" But the user wants antonyms for the noun, so maybe \"commoner\" or \"layperson\" are the antonyms. Let me check if there are more. Maybe \"public official\" is the antonym, but that's not a single word. So the answer should be two words: \"commoner; layperson\" or something like that. But the user said maximum 2, so I can list them as two. Wait, the example in the problem shows if there are multiple, join them with semicolons. So maybe \"commoner; layperson\" is the answer. But I need to confirm if those are correct. Alternatively, \"public official\" is a possible antonym, but that's a noun as well. So maybe \"public official\" is the antonym. But the user might expect \"commoner\" or \"layperson.\" I think the correct antonyms are \"commoner\" and \"layperson.\" So the answer would be \"commoner; layperson.\"\n...done thinking.\n\ncommoner; layperson"
