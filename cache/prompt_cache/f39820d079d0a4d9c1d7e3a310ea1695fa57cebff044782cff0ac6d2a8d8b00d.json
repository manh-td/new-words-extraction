  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"groomed\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user wants the antonyms of the word \"groomed\" (adjective). First, I need to make sure I understand what \"groomed\" means. It's an adjective that describes someone who has been carefully prepared or made ready, like a groomed dog or a groomed face. So the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of being prepared or made ready.\n\nWhat are the opposite words? Well, \"unprepared\" comes to mind. If someone is not groomed, they're unprepared. Then there's \"uncultivated\" – but wait, that's more about not being cultivated, which might not fit exactly. Maybe \"untended\" or \"unattended\"? But those are more about not being taken care of. \n\nWait, \"unprepared\" is the most direct antonym. \"Uncultivated\" might not be the best fit here. Let me think again. The word \"groomed\" is related to being prepared, so antonyms would be things that are not prepared. \"Unprepared\" is definitely an antonym. Then, \"unattended\" could be another, but maybe \"untended\" is more about not being cared for. \n\nBut the user asked for antonyms, and the maximum is two. So maybe \"unprepared\" and \"untended\"? But I need to check if \"untended\" is a valid antonym. Alternatively, \"unmannered\" might not be right. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe \"unprepared\" is the primary antonym, and \"uncultivated\" is another. But I'm not sure if \"uncultivated\" is the best fit here. Maybe \"unattended\" is better. But I think the most accurate antonyms are \"unprepared\" and \"untended\". However, I need to make sure these are correct. \n\nAlternatively, \"untrimmed\" could be an antonym, but that's more about not being trimmed. Maybe \"untrimmed\" is not the best. \n\nSo, the two antonyms would be \"unprepared\" and \"untended\". But I need to check if \"untended\" is a valid antonym. Maybe \"unattended\" is better. But I think the user expects the most accurate answers. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"unprepared; untended\".\n...done thinking.\n\nunprepared; untended"
