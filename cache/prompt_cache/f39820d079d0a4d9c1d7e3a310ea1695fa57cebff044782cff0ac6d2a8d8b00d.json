  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"groomed\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of the word \"groomed\" (an adjective). First, I need to recall what the antonyms are. \"Groomed\" means to prepare or train someone for a role, like a groomed dog. The antonyms would be words that mean not prepared or not trained. \n\nSo, possible antonyms could be \"untrained\" or \"unprepared\". Wait, but the user specified \"antonyms\" and wants them in a string separated by semicolons. Let me check if there are exactly two. \"Untrained\" and \"unprepared\" are both valid antonyms. Are there any others? Maybe \"raw\" or \"unprocessed\"? But \"raw\" is more about not processed, not necessarily about being trained. So probably \"untrained\" and \"unprepared\" are the best choices. Let me confirm. Yes, those are direct antonyms. So the answer should be \"untrained; unprepared\".\n...done thinking.\n\nuntrained; unprepared"
