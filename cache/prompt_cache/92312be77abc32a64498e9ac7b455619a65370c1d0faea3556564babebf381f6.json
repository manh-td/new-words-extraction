  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"barnacles\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for antonyms of the verb \"barnacles\". First, I need to make sure I understand what \"barnacles\" means. From what I know, barnacles are small marine organisms that attach to boats and other surfaces. So the verb \"barnacles\" might mean to attach or stick to something, like a boat.\n\nNow, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of \"barnacles\". The opposite of attaching would be something like detaching, removing, or freeing. But since the verb is \"barnacles\", the antonyms would be words that indicate the opposite action. \n\nPossible antonyms could be \"remove\" or \"detach\". Let me think. If the action is to attach, the antonym would be to remove. So \"remove\" is an antonym. Another possible antonym is \"detach\", which directly means to separate. Both are valid. But the user wants up to two antonyms. So I can list both. \n\nWait, the user said \"maximum 2\" so two is okay. So the answer would be \"remove; detach\". But I need to make sure there's no better pair. Maybe \"separate\" is also an antonym, but \"detach\" is more specific. \"Remove\" is more general. So either is acceptable. The user might accept both. So the final answer is \"remove; detach\".\n...done thinking.\n\nremove; detach"
