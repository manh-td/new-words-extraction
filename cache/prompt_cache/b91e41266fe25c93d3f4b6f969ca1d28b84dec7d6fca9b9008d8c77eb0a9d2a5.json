  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences using the word \"attestation\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. Attestation is a noun, and it refers to a formal statement or confirmation. So, possible sentences could involve legal documents or certifications.\n\nHmm, the user specified maximum two sentences. Let me come up with two examples. Maybe one about a legal document and another about a certification. Let me check if those make sense. \n\nFirst sentence: \"The lawyer reviewed the attestation to confirm the client's identity.\" That's a valid use. Second sentence: \"The company required employees to sign their attestation to comply with labor laws.\" That also works. \n\nI should make sure the sentences are simple and correct. No need for explanations, just the sentences. Alright, that should do it.\n...done thinking.\n\nattestation; the lawyer reviewed the attestation to confirm the client's identity; attestation; the company required employees to sign their attestation to comply with labor laws"
