  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to create two example sentences using the word \"attestation\" as a noun. Let me think about how to use it in different contexts.\n\nFirst, \"attestation\" can mean a formal statement or proof. So maybe a sentence about a legal document. Like, \"The lawyer reviewed the attestation to confirm the client's identity.\" That makes sense.\n\nAnother use could be in a scientific context. For example, \"The research team obtained the attestation from the lab equipment manufacturer to ensure compliance with safety standards.\" That shows it in a technical setting.\n\nWait, I should check if the word is commonly used in those contexts. Legal documents are a standard use, and scientific compliance is also plausible. Yeah, those examples should work. Let me make sure the sentences are clear and use the word correctly as a noun. No need for any extra info, just the sentences.\n...done thinking.\n\nattestation; the lawyer reviewed the attestation to confirm the client's identity; attestation; the research team obtained the attestation from the lab equipment manufacturer to ensure compliance with safety standards"
