  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"primate\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants synonyms for the word \"primate\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to recall what \"primate\" means. It refers to a large, intelligent animal, like apes or monkeys. So synonyms would be animals that are similar in size and intelligence to apes.\n\nThe most common synonyms I can think of are \"ape\" and \"monkey.\" But wait, are there other options? Maybe \"great ape\"? But that's more specific. The question says \"primate\" as a noun, so maybe \"ape\" is sufficient. However, \"monkey\" is also a primate. So the two best synonyms would be \"ape\" and \"monkey.\" Let me check if there's a standard list. In dictionaries, \"ape\" is often listed as a synonym. \"Monkey\" is also a primate. So the answer should be both. But the user asked for maximum two, so I can list them as \"ape; monkey\".\n...done thinking.\n\nape; monkey"
