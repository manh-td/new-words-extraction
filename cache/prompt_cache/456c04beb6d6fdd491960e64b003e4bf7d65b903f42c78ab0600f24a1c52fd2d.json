  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"primate\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"primate\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"primate\" means. From what I remember, a primate is an animal that is part of the order Primates, which includes monkeys, apes, and other similar creatures. So, synonyms would be words that mean the same thing.\n\nFirst, I need to think of other nouns that refer to primates. The most obvious ones are monkeys and apes. But wait, are there any other common terms? Maybe \"ape\" is a synonym, but I should check if \"monkey\" is considered a synonym here. Sometimes people use \"monkey\" more generally, while \"ape\" is more specific. However, in the context of the order Primates, both are included.\n\nSo, the two main synonyms would be monkey and ape. Let me verify if there are any other terms. \"Orangutan\" is a type of ape, but that's a specific species. The user wants synonyms for the order, not specific species. So \"monkey\" and \"ape\" are the best choices. \n\nI should make sure not to include any other words. The answer should be two synonyms joined by a semicolon. Let me check the maximum allowed, which is two. So the final answer would be \"monkey; ape\".\n...done thinking.\n\nmonkey; ape"
