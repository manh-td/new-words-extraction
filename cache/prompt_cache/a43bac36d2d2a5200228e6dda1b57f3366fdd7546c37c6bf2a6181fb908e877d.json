  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"niche\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the word \"niche\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. A niche is a specific area or a small part of something. So, maybe something like a niche in a company or a niche market.\n\nWait, the user specified \"noun\" so the sentences should use it as a noun. Let me check. For example, \"The company identified a niche market for eco-friendly products.\" That works. Another example could be \"She found a niche in writing poetry.\" That's another valid sentence. I need to make sure they're correct and not too similar. Also, the format is required to be exactly as specified, no JSON or explanation. So just the two sentences separated by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\nniche; the small valley in the mountain is a niche for wildflowers; niche; the company identified a niche market for eco-friendly products"
