  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences for the word \"niche\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. A niche is a specific area or a small part of something. So, possible sentences could involve something specific, like a niche in a market or a niche in a habitat.\n\nHmm, the user asked for maximum two sentences. Let me come up with two clear examples. Maybe one about a niche in a market and another about a biological niche. That should cover different contexts. I need to check if the sentences are correct and use the word properly. Yeah, \"niche\" as a noun is correct in both cases. Alright, that should work.\n...done thinking.\n\nniche; a small part of a larger whole; niche; a place where a particular species lives"
