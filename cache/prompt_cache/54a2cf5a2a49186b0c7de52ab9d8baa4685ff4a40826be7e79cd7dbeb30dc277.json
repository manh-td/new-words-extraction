  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"elitist\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants examples of how to use the word \"elitist\" as an adjective. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Elitist\" means showing favoritism towards people from a particular social class, usually the upper class. So, the examples should show someone who favors the upper class or is biased towards them.\n\nI should create two sentences. The first one could be something like \"The elitist politician often ignores the needs of the common people.\" That shows someone in a position of power favoring the elite. The second example might be \"She's an elitist who only admires people from her own social circle.\" This illustrates someone who is biased towards their own group. I need to check if these examples are clear and correct. Also, make sure not to use any markdown and keep it simple. Alright, that should do it.\n...done thinking.\n\nelitist; the elitist politician often ignores the needs of the common people; elitist; she's an elitist who only admires people from her own social circle"
