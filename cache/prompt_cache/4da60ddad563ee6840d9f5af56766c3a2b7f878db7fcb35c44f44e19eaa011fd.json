  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"elitist\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of \"elitist\" (an adjective). Let me think. First, I need to recall what the antonyms of \"elitist\" are. \"Elitist\" means showing favoritism towards people from a certain class or group, usually the upper class. So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite, like not favoring someone based on class.\n\nThe most obvious antonym here is \"inclusive\" because it means open to all, not just a specific group. Another one could be \"accessible,\" which means open to people from different backgrounds. Wait, but \"accessible\" is more about being open to access rather than class-based favoritism. Maybe \"inclusive\" is better. Let me check another angle. Words like \"democratic\" or \"egalitarian\" come to mind, but those are more about equality than class. \n\nSo the two strongest antonyms are \"inclusive\" and \"accessible.\" But I need to make sure they are indeed antonyms. \"Inclusive\" refers to including people from various groups, while \"accessible\" refers to being open to access. Both are opposites in the context of favoring certain classes. So the answer should be \"inclusive; accessible\".\n...done thinking.\n\ninclusive; accessible"
