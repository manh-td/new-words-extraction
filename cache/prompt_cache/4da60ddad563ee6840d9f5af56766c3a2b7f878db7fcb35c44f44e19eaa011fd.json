  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"elitist\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user asked for the antonyms of \"elitist\" (an adjective). First, I need to recall what the antonyms are. \"Elitist\" means showing favoritism towards the upper class or those who have privilege. So, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. \n\nHmm, \"elitist\" is about being superior or favored by the upper class. So, antonyms might be words like \"common\" or \"popular\". But wait, \"common\" is more about being ordinary, while \"popular\" is about being favored by the大众. \n\nAnother thought: \"elitist\" can also mean having a superior attitude. So, antonyms could be \"down-to-earth\" or \"ordinary\". But \"down-to-earth\" is more about being practical, not necessarily about being from the lower class. \n\nWait, the user wants antonyms for \"elitist\" as an adjective. So, the most direct antonyms would be \"common\" and \"popular\". But I need to check if those are accurate. \n\nAlternatively, \"unpretentious\" might be another one, but that's more about not being pretentious. Maybe \"democratic\" or \"inclusive\"? No, those are more about fairness. \n\nWait, \"elitist\" is about favoring the upper class. So, antonyms could be \"mass\" or \"common\". But \"mass\" is more about the general population. \n\nI think the best antonyms here are \"common\" and \"popular\". Let me confirm. Yes, \"common\" means not exclusive, and \"popular\" means widely accepted. So, those are the antonyms. \n\nSo the answer should be \"common; popular\".\n...done thinking.\n\ncommon; popular"
