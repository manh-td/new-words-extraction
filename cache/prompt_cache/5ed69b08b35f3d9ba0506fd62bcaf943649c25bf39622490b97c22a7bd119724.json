  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"guise\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"guise\" as a noun. Let me start by making sure I understand what \"guise\" means. From what I know, \"guise\" refers to the appearance or form that someone takes, especially to hide their true identity. So, it's about pretending to be someone else.\n\nNow, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of \"guise.\" The primary opposite here would be \"truth\" because if you're in a guise, you're pretending, so the truth is the real you. Another possible antonym might be \"real\" since \"guise\" implies a fake or pretended appearance. But I need to check if those are considered antonyms in this context.\n\nWait, \"real\" can sometimes be used as an adjective, but in this case, \"real\" as a noun might not be the best antonym. The most direct antonym would be \"truth,\" as it's the opposite of pretending. \"Real\" might be more of a modifier here. So, the answer should be \"truth\" and maybe \"real,\" but I need to confirm if \"real\" is considered an antonym here. \n\nAlternatively, \"truth\" is a clear antonym. \"Real\" could be seen as the opposite in some contexts, but maybe the user expects a more straightforward answer. Let me think again. \"Guise\" is about appearance, so the antonyms would be things that are not fake or pretended. \"Truth\" is the real thing, and \"real\" as in \"real person\" might fit. But maybe \"real\" is more of a modifier. \n\nIn dictionaries, antonyms for \"guise\" might include \"truth\" and \"real.\" However, \"real\" as a noun is less common. So, the answer should be \"truth; real.\" But I need to check if \"real\" is considered an antonym here. Alternatively, maybe \"truth\" is the only one. \n\nWait, the user specified \"antonyms\" and wants up to two. If \"real\" is acceptable, then both. But if not, just \"truth.\" But I think \"truth\" is the primary antonym. So, the answer is \"truth; real.\"\n...done thinking.\n\ntruth; real"
