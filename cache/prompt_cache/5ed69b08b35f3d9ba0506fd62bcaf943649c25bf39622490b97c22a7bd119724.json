  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"guise\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for antonyms of the word \"guise\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"guise\" means. From what I remember, \"guise\" refers to the appearance or way in which someone presents themselves, especially to deceive others. So, it's about pretending to be someone else.\n\nNow, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of \"guise.\" The primary antonyms I can think of are \"truth\" and \"realness.\" \"Truth\" directly opposes the idea of pretending or deceiving. \"Realness\" is more about being genuine, which also contrasts with the fake appearance of a guise.\n\nWait, are there any other possible antonyms? Maybe \"authenticity\"? That's related but maybe slightly different. However, the user specified \"antonyms\" and the maximum is two. So, \"truth\" and \"realness\" seem appropriate. Let me check if \"authenticity\" is considered an antonym here. Hmm, \"authenticity\" is about being genuine, so it's similar to \"realness\" but maybe more specific. However, the user might expect the most direct antonyms. \n\nSo, the answer should be \"truth; realness\" or \"truth; authenticity\"? I need to decide. Since \"realness\" is more about the state of being real, while \"authenticity\" is about the quality of being authentic. Both are valid, but maybe \"realness\" is more commonly used in this context. Alternatively, \"truth\" is more straightforward. \n\nI think the best answer here is \"truth; realness\" as they are the most direct antonyms. Let me confirm by thinking of common usage. Yes, \"guise\" is about pretending, so the antonyms would be the opposite of that. So, \"truth\" and \"realness\" are correct. I'll go with that.\n...done thinking.\n\ntruth; realness"
