  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"transfixed\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the word \"transfixed\" as a verb. Let me think about how to use it correctly.\n\nFirst, \"transfixed\" means to make someone so amazed that they can't look away. So, maybe something like \"The actor was transfixed by the beauty of the sunset.\" That uses the idea of being amazed. \n\nAnother example could be in a more formal context. Maybe \"The scientist was transfixed by the complexity of the data.\" That shows the word in a professional setting. \n\nWait, I should check if the sentences are correct. \"Transfixed\" is usually followed by a noun, like \"transfixed by...\" so the sentences should be structured correctly. \n\nAlso, make sure the sentences are simple and clear. Avoid any complex structures. Let me confirm the usage. Yes, both sentences use the correct structure. \n\nSo the final answer would be those two sentences.\n...done thinking.\n\ntransfixed; The actor was transfixed by the beauty of the sunset.  \ntransfixed; The scientist was transfixed by the complexity of the data."
