  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"contemporary\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"contemporary\" as a noun. First, I need to recall what contemporary means. It refers to something that is current, modern, or from the present day. So antonyms would be things that are old, traditional, or from a past era.\n\nThinking about nouns, antonyms for contemporary could be \"archaic\" or \"historical\". But wait, the question specifies \"noun\" so maybe \"archaic\" is better. Another possible antonym is \"traditional\", but that's more of an adjective. Hmm. Let me check.\n\n\"Contemporary\" can also mean modern, so antonyms might be \"old-fashioned\" or \"outdated\". But the user asked for nouns. \"Old-fashioned\" is an adjective. \"Outdated\" is an adjective too. So maybe \"archaic\" and \"traditional\" are better. But I need to make sure they are nouns. \"Archaic\" is an adjective, but sometimes used as a noun. \"Traditional\" is an adjective. Wait, maybe \"outdated\" as a noun? Not sure. Maybe the best antonyms are \"archaic\" and \"traditional\". Alternatively, \"old\" as a noun? But \"old\" is an adjective. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user said \"noun\" so maybe \"archaic\" and \"traditional\" are acceptable. Alternatively, \"old\" and \"historical\". But \"old\" as a noun? Maybe not. So the safest antonyms are \"archaic\" and \"historical\". Let me confirm. Contemporary is modern, so antonyms are old, traditional, historical, etc. But as nouns, \"archaic\" and \"historical\" are more appropriate. So the answer should be \"archaic; historical\".\n...done thinking.\n\narchaic; historical"
