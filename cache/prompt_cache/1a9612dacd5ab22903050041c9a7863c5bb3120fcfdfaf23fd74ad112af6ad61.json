  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"contemporary\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"contemporary\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"contemporary\" means. It refers to something that is current, modern, or related to the present time. So, antonyms would be words that mean something old, traditional, or from a bygone era.\n\nFirst, I need to think of the most common antonyms. \"Traditional\" comes to mind because it's about old-fashioned practices or beliefs. Then there's \"archaic,\" which describes something old or obsolete. Are there any others? \"Classic\" might work too, but I should check if it's considered an antonym here. \"Outdated\" is another possibility, but that's more about being not current. \n\nWait, the user specified \"noun,\" so maybe \"archaic\" is better because it's a noun. \"Traditional\" is also a noun. So both could be valid. Let me confirm. \"Traditional\" is an adjective here, but the user might be looking for nouns. However, the original word is a noun, so the antonyms should also be nouns. \"Archaic\" is a noun, so that's good. \"Outdated\" is an adjective, but maybe the user wants nouns. \n\nSo the two antonyms would be \"traditional\" and \"archaic.\" But I need to make sure there's no other common noun antonym. \"Classic\" is another option, but I'm not sure if it's considered an antonym here. Maybe the user expects the most direct antonyms. \n\nI think the best answer is \"traditional; archaic.\" Let me double-check. Yes, those are the most common antonyms for \"contemporary\" as a noun. No other nouns come to mind immediately. So the final answer should be those two joined by a semicolon.\n...done thinking.\n\ntraditional; archaic"
