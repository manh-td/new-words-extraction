  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"elitist\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"elitist\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what an elitist is. An elitist is someone who belongs to or supports a particular elite group, often implying that they are superior or superior in status. So, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean the opposite of \"elitist.\" The direct antonyms might be \"commoner\" or \"popular,\" but since the user specified \"noun,\" I need to check if those are nouns. \"Commoner\" is a noun, referring to someone from the common class. \"Popular\" is an adjective, so maybe not. Another possibility is \"massman\" or \"massperson,\" but those are less common. \n\nWait, \"elitist\" is a noun, so the antonyms should also be nouns. \"Commoner\" fits. Another possible antonym is \"average,\" but that's more of an adjective. \"Peasant\" is a noun, but it's more about lower class. \"Massman\" is a less common term. \n\nI should check if there are standard antonyms. In some dictionaries, \"elitist\" antonyms include \"common\" or \"popular,\" but as nouns, \"commoner\" is more accurate. \"Massman\" is a less common noun. So the main antonyms are \"commoner\" and \"massman.\" But I need to make sure. \n\nAlternatively, \"popular\" as an adjective could be used, but the user wants nouns. So the best antonyms are \"commoner\" and \"massman.\" But I should confirm if \"massman\" is a valid noun. Maybe \"commoner\" is the primary one. \n\nSo the answer should be \"commoner; massman\" separated by semicolons. But I need to check if \"massman\" is acceptable. Maybe \"commoner\" is the main one. Alternatively, \"average\" as a noun, but that's not exactly the opposite. \n\nI think the correct antonyms are \"commoner\" and \"massman.\" So the final answer is \"commoner; massman\".\n...done thinking.\n\ncommoner; massman"
