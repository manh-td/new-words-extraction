  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"elitist\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"elitist\" as a noun. First, I need to recall what an elitist is. They refer to someone who belongs to a privileged class and maintains superiority over others. So, antonyms would be words that contrast with this idea.\n\nThe primary antonyms might be \"common\" or \"popular\" because those words describe people from the general population. But since the question specifies \"noun,\" I need to check if \"common\" is a noun. Yes, \"common\" can be a noun meaning the general population. Another possible antonym is \"mass\" which refers to the general masses. However, \"mass\" is more commonly used as a noun in this context. \n\nWait, \"popular\" as a noun could also be a contender, but \"common\" is more directly antonymous. Let me verify. \"Elitist\" vs. \"common\" – yes, they contrast. \"Mass\" is less common but still valid. So the two antonyms would be \"common\" and \"mass.\" But the user asked for maximum two, so both are acceptable. Join them with semicolons. \n\nI should make sure there's no other strong antonyms. \"Ordinary\" is another possibility, but that's more of an adjective. So the correct answer is \"common; mass\".\n...done thinking.\n\ncommon; mass"
