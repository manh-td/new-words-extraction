  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"barnacles\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the verb \"barnacles\". Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Barnacles\" as a verb means to attach or fasten something to a surface, right? So synonyms would be words that mean to fasten or secure.\n\nHmm, what are some synonyms for \"barnacles\"? Let's see. \"Secure\" comes to mind because that's a direct synonym. Then there's \"fasten\" which is a direct synonym as well. But wait, the user wants maximum two synonyms. So maybe \"secure\" and \"fasten\" are the top ones. Are there any others? \"Attach\" is another possible synonym, but that's more general. \"Fix\" is also a synonym, but maybe too broad. \n\nWait, the user specified \"verb\" so maybe \"secure\" and \"fasten\" are better. Let me check if those are accurate. Yes, \"secure\" and \"fasten\" are both verbs that mean to attach or fasten something. So the answer should be those two. I need to make sure not to include any other words unless they are definitely synonyms. \"Fix\" is a synonym but maybe less common in this context. So the final answer is \"secure; fasten\".\n...done thinking.\n\nsecure; fasten"
