  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"rekindled\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to create two example sentences using the word \"rekindled\" as a verb. Let me think about how to use it correctly.\n\nFirst, \"rekindled\" means to revive or reignite a feeling or passion. So maybe something like a relationship that was cold being rekindled. That makes sense. Then another example could be a fire that was put out being rekindled. That's a common metaphor.\n\nWait, I should check if \"rekindled\" is indeed a verb. Yes, it is. So the sentences need to use it in the correct form. Let me make sure the sentences are simple and natural. \n\nFirst sentence: \"The old friendship was rekindled after years of silence.\" Second sentence: \"The dying fire was rekindled by a spark.\" \n\nYes, those examples work. They show the action of reviving something, whether it's a relationship or a fire. The user asked for maximum two sentences, so that's covered. No markdown, just plain text. Alright, that should do it.\n...done thinking.\n\nrekindled; the old friendship was rekindled after years of silence; the dying fire was rekindled by a spark"
