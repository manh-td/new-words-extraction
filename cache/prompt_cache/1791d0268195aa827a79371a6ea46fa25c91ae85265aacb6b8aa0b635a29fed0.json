  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"obscure\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the verb \"obscure\". Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the correct meaning of the verb. \"Obscure\" means to make something less visible or understood, or to make something unclear. So, possible sentences could involve making something obscure or making something unclear.\n\nSentence 1: Maybe something like \"The teacher tried to obscure the truth from the students.\" That uses the verb in the sense of making something unclear. Then Sentence 2: Perhaps \"The artist used dark colors to obscure the details of the painting.\" Here, it's making the details less visible. Wait, but \"obscure\" can also mean to make something less visible, so maybe another example. Alternatively, \"The government sought to obscure the results of the election.\" That's another usage. Let me check if those are correct. Yes, \"obscure\" can mean to make something less visible or to make something unclear. So those two sentences should work. I need to make sure they're concise and fit the format. Also, the user wants maximum two sentences, so I can't go beyond that. Alright, that should do it.\n...done thinking.\n\nobscure the truth from the students; obscure the details of the painting"
