  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"maneuvers\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"maneuvers\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"maneuvers\" means. It refers to the actions or operations performed by a military or tactical group, especially in a controlled or coordinated way.\n\nFirst, I need to think of other nouns that can replace \"maneuvers\" in the same context. Words like \"operations\" come to mind because both refer to planned actions. Then there's \"actions\" as a synonym, but I need to check if that's appropriate here. \"Actions\" is more general, while \"operations\" is more specific to military or tactical use.\n\nWait, \"tactics\" is another possible synonym. But does it fit as a noun? Yes, tactics refer to the strategies or plans of action. However, \"maneuvers\" is more about the actual movements or actions taken, so \"tactics\" might be a bit broader. \n\nAnother option is \"movements,\" but that's more about physical movement. \"Operations\" seems better because it's specifically about planned actions. Let me verify if \"operations\" is commonly used in this context. Yes, in military terms, operations refer to the entire plan of action. \n\nSo the two best synonyms would be \"operations\" and \"actions.\" But I need to make sure they're accurate. \"Actions\" can be used, but \"operations\" is more precise. However, the user asked for synonyms, so both could be acceptable. \n\nWait, the user said maximum two synonyms. So I can list both. But maybe \"tactics\" is also a good synonym. Let me check. \"Tactics\" is a noun meaning the strategies or plans of action. So that's another possible synonym. \n\nSo the possible synonyms are \"operations,\" \"actions,\" and \"tactics.\" But the user wants up to two. Which ones are most accurate? \"Operations\" is more specific to military use, while \"tactics\" is broader. \"Actions\" is more general. \n\nI think the best two synonyms would be \"operations\" and \"tactics.\" But I need to confirm. Alternatively, \"movements\" might be another option, but that's more about physical movement. \n\nSo final answer: operations; tactics. But I should check if \"tactics\" is considered a synonym here. Yes, in the context of military maneuvers, tactics are the strategies. So both are valid. But the user might expect \"operations\" as the primary synonym. \n\nAlternatively, \"plans\" could be a synonym, but that's more about the overall plan. So maybe \"operations\" and \"tactics\" are the best choices. I'll go with those.\n...done thinking.\n\noperations;tactics"
