  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"maneuvers\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for synonyms of \"maneuvers\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Maneuvers\" can mean a series of actions or movements, especially in a military or tactical context. So, synonyms would be words that mean the same thing.\n\nI remember that \"operations\" is often used in military contexts, like a series of planned actions. Then there's \"actions\" which is more general. Wait, but the user specified \"noun,\" so maybe \"operations\" is more accurate. Another possibility is \"movements,\" but that's more about the physical movement. \"Steps\" might be too general. \"Plans\" could work, but that's more about a strategy. \n\nSo the top synonyms would be \"operations\" and \"actions.\" Let me check if \"operations\" is commonly used for maneuvers in military terms. Yes, military maneuvers are indeed operations. \"Actions\" is more general, so it's a valid synonym. I think that's it. The user wants up to two synonyms, so I'll list them as \"operations; actions.\"\n...done thinking.\n\noperations; actions"
