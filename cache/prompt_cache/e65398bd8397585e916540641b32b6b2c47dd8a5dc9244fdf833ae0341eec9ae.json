  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"anthropologist\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"anthropologist\" as a noun. Let me think. An anthropologist is someone who studies humans, so the antonyms would be someone who studies other beings or non-humans. Maybe \"mythologist\" since they study myths, but that's more about stories. Wait, the main antonyms here would be \"mythologist\" and \"paleontologist\" because they study ancient humans or other creatures. But the user specified \"non-humans,\" so maybe \"paleontologist\" is more accurate. Let me check. Anthropologists study humans, so the antonyms would be those who study other beings. So \"mythologist\" and \"paleontologist\" are both antonyms. But I need to make sure. Another possibility is \"zoologist\" but that's about animals. So the best antonyms are \"mythologist\" and \"paleontologist\". Join them with semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\nmythologist;paleontologist"
