  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"anthropologist\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for antonyms of \"anthropologist\" (noun). Let me think. An anthropologist studies humans, so antonyms would be something related to not humans. Maybe \"zoologist\" which studies animals. Another one could be \"botanist\" for plants. Wait, but the question specifies \"antonyms\" and the example shows two, so maybe two. Let me check if those are correct. Zoologist is a valid antonym, and botanist is also a valid one. So the answer should be \"zoologist; botanist\".\n...done thinking.\n\nzoologist; botanist"
