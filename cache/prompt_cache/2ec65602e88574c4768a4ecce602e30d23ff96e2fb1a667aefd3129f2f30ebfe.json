  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"menial\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants synonyms for \"menial\" as a noun. First, I need to recall what a menial is. From what I know, a menial is someone who does menial tasks, like cleaning or preparing food. So synonyms would be words that mean someone who does simple tasks.\n\nThinking of nouns, \"servant\" comes to mind because a servant is someone who serves, which is similar. Then there's \"dominant\" but that's an adjective. Wait, no, \"dominant\" isn't a noun here. Maybe \"assistant\"? But an assistant is more general. \"Helpful\" is an adjective. \n\nWait, \"menial\" can also mean a lowly servant. So \"servant\" is a direct synonym. Another possible one might be \"servant\" or \"worker\". But \"worker\" is more general. Let me check. In dictionaries, \"menial\" is often listed with \"servant\" as a synonym. Are there others? Maybe \"laborer\"? But that's more about working, not specifically menial. \n\nSo the best synonyms are \"servant\" and \"worker\". But the user asked for maximum two, so I can list them as \"servant; worker\". But I need to make sure these are accurate. Let me confirm. Yes, \"menial\" is a synonym for \"servant\" and \"worker\" is a more general term. So the answer should be \"servant; worker\".\n...done thinking.\n\nservant; worker"
