  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"menial\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"menial\" (noun). Let me think. Menial means a servant or a person who does menial tasks. So synonyms could be things like servant, assistant, or helpmate. But I need to make sure they're nouns. \"Servant\" is a noun, \"assistant\" is also a noun, and \"helpmate\" is a noun too. Are there any other common synonyms? Maybe \"dominion\" isn't right. Let me check. \"Menial\" is often used in the context of someone who does simple tasks, so \"servant\" and \"assistant\" are the most common. I should list them as synonyms. Wait, the user said maximum 2, so I can pick two. Let me confirm the most accurate ones. Yes, \"servant\" and \"assistant\" are correct. So the answer should be \"servant; assistant\".\n...done thinking.\n\nservant; assistant"
