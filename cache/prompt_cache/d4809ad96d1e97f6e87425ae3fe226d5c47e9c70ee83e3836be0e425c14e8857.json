  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"flounder\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"flounder\" as a noun. Let me think. Flounder is a type of fish, right? So synonyms would be other fish names. I remember that \"flounder\" is sometimes referred to as \"fluke\" in some contexts, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Wait, maybe \"flounder\" is a type of fish, and its synonyms could be \"rockfish\" or \"hake\" or \"herring\"? Hmm, I need to be precise here. Let me check my knowledge. Oh, right, \"flounder\" is a specific species, but sometimes people use \"fluke\" as a synonym. However, \"fluke\" is more commonly used as a noun for a different type of fish. So maybe the best synonyms are \"rockfish\" and \"hake\". Alternatively, \"flounder\" can also be called \"fluke\" in some regions. But I should verify if \"fluke\" is considered a synonym here. If the user is looking for common synonyms, \"rockfish\" and \"hake\" might be more accurate. Let me make sure. Yes, \"flounder\" is a type of fish, and \"rockfish\" is another species, while \"hake\" is a different type. So the synonyms would be \"rockfish\" and \"hake\". But wait, the user might expect \"fluke\" as a synonym. However, I need to check if that's correct. If \"fluke\" is considered a synonym, then it would be another option. But I'm not entirely sure. To be safe, I'll list the most accurate synonyms. So the answer would be \"rockfish; hake\" or \"fluke\". But I need to decide which ones are more commonly accepted. Since \"fluke\" is sometimes used as a synonym, but I'm not sure if it's considered a standard synonym here. Maybe the user wants the most accurate ones. So I'll go with \"rockfish\" and \"hake\" as the synonyms.\n...done thinking.\n\nrockfish; hake"
