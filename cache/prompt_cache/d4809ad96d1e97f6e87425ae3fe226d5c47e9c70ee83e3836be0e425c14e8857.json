  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"flounder\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"flounder\" as a noun. Let me think. Flounder is a type of fish, right? So synonyms would be other fish names. I remember \"flounder\" is sometimes called a \"flounder\" in some contexts, but maybe there are more common synonyms. Let me recall... There's \"perch\" which is a type of fish, but is that considered a synonym here? Or maybe \"cod\"? Wait, cod is a different fish. But the user specified \"flounder\" as the word, so maybe they want exact synonyms. Hmm. Alternatively, \"flounder\" is also known as \"flounder\" in some regions, but that's the same word. So maybe the synonyms are \"cod\" and \"perch\"? Or is there another one? Let me check. Oh, \"flounder\" is also called \"flounder\" in some dialects, but that's not a synonym. So the main synonyms would be \"cod\" and \"perch\". But I need to make sure they are correct. Alternatively, \"flounder\" is sometimes referred to as \"flounder\" in some contexts, but that's not a synonym. So the answer should be \"cod; perch\" or something like that. Wait, but maybe \"flounder\" is a type of fish, and the synonyms are \"cod\" and \"perch\". Yes, I think that's right. So the answer is cod; perch.\n...done thinking.\n\ncod; perch"
