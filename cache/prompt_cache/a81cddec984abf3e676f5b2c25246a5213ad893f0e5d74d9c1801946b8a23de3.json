  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bohemian\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants synonyms for the word \"bohemian\" (an adjective). Let me think. A bohemian is someone who lives a bohemian life, which means they are artistic, unconventional, and maybe a bit dissolute. So synonyms could be things like \"artistic\" or \"free-spirited.\" Wait, but are those accurate? \"Artistic\" is more about talent, while \"free-spirited\" emphasizes the lifestyle. Maybe \"eccentric\" is another option? Hmm, but I should check if those are commonly accepted synonyms. Let me recall. \"Bohemian\" is often associated with a reject of societal norms, so \"free-spirited\" and \"eccentric\" might fit. But \"artistic\" is more about the person's skills. Maybe the best synonyms here are \"free-spirited\" and \"eccentric.\" Let me confirm. Yes, those are commonly used. So the answer should be \"free-spirited; eccentric.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nfree-spirited; eccentric"
