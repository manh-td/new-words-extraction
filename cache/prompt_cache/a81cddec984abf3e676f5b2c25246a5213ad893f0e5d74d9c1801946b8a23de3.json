  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bohemian\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants synonyms for the word \"bohemian\" (an adjective). Let me think. First, I need to recall what synonyms are commonly used for bohemian. Bohemian usually refers to someone who is unconventional, artistic, or living a free-spirited life. So possible synonyms might be \"free-spirited\" or \"artistic.\" Wait, but \"artistic\" is more about the trait itself, while \"free-spirited\" describes the person's attitude. Are there other options? Maybe \"eccentric\"? That's another synonym. But I need to check if those are considered synonyms here. \"Eccentric\" is often used in the same context. So maybe \"free-spirited; eccentric.\" But I should make sure not to include words that are too similar. Let me verify. \"Bohemian\" and \"eccentric\" are both used to describe someone who is unconventional. \"Free-spirited\" is more about the attitude. So the best synonyms would be \"eccentric\" and \"free-spirited.\" But the user asked for maximum two, so I can list them as two. Alternatively, \"artistic\" might be another option, but I think \"free-spirited\" and \"eccentric\" are more accurate. Let me check a dictionary. Yes, \"eccentric\" and \"free-spirited\" are commonly used synonyms. So the answer should be those two.\n...done thinking.\n\nfree-spirited; eccentric"
