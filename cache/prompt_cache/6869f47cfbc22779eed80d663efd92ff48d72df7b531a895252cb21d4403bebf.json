  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"oar\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"oar\" as a verb. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Oar\" as a verb means to row a boat, right? So synonyms would be words that mean to row or to move in a boat with oars.\n\nHmm, what are the synonyms for \"oar\" as a verb? Let me recall. There's \"row\" which is the most direct synonym. Then maybe \"sail\" since rowing a boat is similar to sailing. Wait, but \"sail\" is more about using a sail rather than oars. So maybe \"row\" is the primary synonym. Are there others? \"Boar\" is a different word, meaning a wild pig, so that's not relevant here. \"Crank\" is a synonym for row in some contexts, but I'm not sure if that's commonly accepted. \n\nWait, the user specified \"oar\" as a verb, so maybe \"row\" is the main one. \"Sail\" might not be accurate because it's about a different method. So the best synonyms would be \"row\" and \"crank\". But I need to check if \"crank\" is indeed a synonym. Let me think. \"Crank\" can mean to row, especially in the context of a boat. So yes, that's a valid synonym. \n\nSo the answer should list \"row\" and \"crank\" as synonyms. But I need to make sure there are only two. The user said maximum two, so that's okay. Join them with semicolons. So the final answer would be \"row; crank\".\n...done thinking.\n\nrow; crank"
