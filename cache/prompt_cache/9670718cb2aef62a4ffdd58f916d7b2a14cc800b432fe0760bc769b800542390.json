  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"obscure\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"obscure\" as a verb. Let me start by recalling what \"obscure\" means. The verb form means to make something unclear or difficult to understand. So, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite—clear, easy to understand, or visible.\n\nFirst, I need to think of the most common antonyms. \"Clear\" comes to mind because if something is clear, it's the opposite of obscure. Then there's \"plain,\" which also means straightforward and easy to understand. Both are valid antonyms. Are there any others? \"Visible\" might be a bit different, but it's more about being noticeable rather than understanding. So maybe \"clear\" and \"plain\" are the best choices.\n\nWait, the user said maximum two antonyms. So I can list them as two. But I need to make sure they are correct. Let me double-check. \"Obscure\" as a verb: antonyms would be words that make something clear or easy to understand. So \"clear\" and \"plain\" are definitely correct. I should present them as the answer, separated by semicolons. No JSON, just plain text. Alright, that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nclear; plain"
