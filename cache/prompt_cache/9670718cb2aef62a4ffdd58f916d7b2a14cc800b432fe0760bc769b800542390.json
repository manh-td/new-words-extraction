  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"obscure\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"obscure\" as a verb. Let me start by recalling what \"obscure\" means. The verb form means to make something unclear or not easily understood. So, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. \n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean the opposite of making something unclear. Words like \"clear\" or \"understood\" come to mind. But wait, the user wants antonyms for the verb \"obscure,\" so maybe \"clear\" is a good one. Another possible antonym is \"expose,\" but that might not be exactly opposite. \"Expose\" could mean to make something known, which is the opposite of obscuring. \n\nWait, \"expose\" as a verb means to make something known, which is the opposite of obscuring. So that's another antonym. Let me check if there are others. \"Unobscure\" is the opposite of obscuring, but the user is asking for antonyms, not the opposite of the verb. So \"unobscure\" is the exact opposite. But the user wants antonyms, so maybe \"unobscure\" is a better answer. \n\nBut the user said maximum 2 antonyms. So if I have \"clear\" and \"unobscure,\" that's two. Alternatively, \"expose\" could be another. Let me verify. \"Obscure\" means to make something unclear, so \"clear\" is the direct antonym. \"Expose\" is to make something known, which is the opposite. \"Unobscure\" is the opposite of obscuring, but that's a different verb. \n\nSo the antonyms would be \"clear\" and \"expose.\" But I need to check if \"unobscure\" is considered an antonym here. Since the user is asking for antonyms of the verb \"obscure,\" \"unobscure\" would be the direct opposite. However, \"clear\" is more about the state, while \"expose\" is about making known. \n\nHmm, maybe the best antonyms are \"clear\" and \"expose.\" But I need to make sure. Let me think again. If the verb is \"obscure,\" the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of making something unclear. So \"clear\" is a direct antonym. \"Expose\" is to make something known, which is the opposite of obscuring. \"Unobscure\" is the opposite of obscuring, but that's a different verb. \n\nSo the answer should be \"clear; expose\" or \"clear; unobscure.\" But the user might expect \"clear\" and \"expose\" as antonyms. Alternatively, \"unobscure\" is the opposite of \"obscure\" as a verb, but that's a different verb. \n\nWait, \"unobscure\" is the opposite of \"obscure\" as a verb, so that's an antonym. But the user might want the most direct antonyms. So maybe the answer is \"clear; unobscure.\" But I need to check if \"expose\" is considered an antonym. \n\nAlternatively, \"expose\" could be considered an antonym in some contexts. But I think \"clear\" is more directly opposite. So the correct antonyms are \"clear\" and \"unobscure.\" But the user might prefer \"clear\" and \"expose.\" \n\nI think the safest answer is \"clear; unobscure\" because \"unobscure\" is the direct opposite of \"obscure\" as a verb. However, \"expose\" is also a valid antonym. But since the user wants maximum 2, and if both are correct, then both can be included. \n\nSo the final answer would be \"clear; expose\" or \"clear; unobscure.\" I need to check which is more accurate. Let me confirm. \n\n\"Obscure\" as a verb means to make something unclear. The direct antonyms are \"clear\" (as in making clear) and \"unobscure\" (as in making something not obscure). \"Expose\" is more about making something known, which is a different meaning. So \"clear\" and \"unobscure\" are the best antonyms. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"clear; unobscure.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nclear; unobscure"
