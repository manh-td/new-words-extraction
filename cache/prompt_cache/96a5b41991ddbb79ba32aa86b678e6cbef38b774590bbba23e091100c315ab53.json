  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"succumbed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"succumbed\" (verb). First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Succumbed\" means to give in, to be overcome, or to fall. So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite—something that doesn't give in, doesn't fall.\n\nThinking of common antonyms for \"succumbed.\" The most obvious ones might be \"resisted\" or \"stood firm.\" But wait, \"resisted\" is more about opposing, while \"stood firm\" is about maintaining. Both could work. Are there others? Maybe \"defied\" or \"overcame.\" But \"overcame\" is more about defeating, whereas \"succumbed\" is about falling. So \"defied\" might be closer. But \"defied\" is a bit more active. \n\nWait, the user asked for antonyms, so the best choices would be the ones that directly oppose the meaning. \"Resisted\" and \"stood firm\" are both antonyms. \"Defied\" is also a good one, but maybe \"stood firm\" is more directly antonymous. Let me check. \"Succumbed\" is to give in, so \"resisted\" is to oppose, \"stood firm\" is to not give in, and \"defied\" is to oppose. So all three could be considered. But the user wants maximum 2. So between \"resisted\" and \"stood firm,\" maybe \"stood firm\" is better. Alternatively, \"defied\" is also a valid antonym. \n\nHmm, but the user might expect the most common ones. Let me think. In standard dictionaries, the antonyms of \"succumbed\" would be \"resisted\" and \"stood firm.\" But \"defied\" is also a possible one. However, since the user asked for maximum 2, I need to pick two. Maybe \"resisted\" and \"stood firm\" are the best choices. Alternatively, \"defied\" and \"stood firm.\" But I think \"resisted\" is more direct. So the answer would be \"resisted; stood firm.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nresisted; stood firm"
