  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"succumbed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"succumbed\" (verb). First, I need to recall what the word means. \"Succumbed\" means to give in, to be defeated, or to fall. So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of being defeated or giving in.\n\nPossible antonyms could be \"resisted\" or \"stood firm\". Let me check. \"Resisted\" means to oppose, which is the opposite of giving in. \"Stood firm\" also means to remain steadfast, which is opposite. Are there any others? Maybe \"overcame\" or \"defeated\"? Wait, \"defeated\" is a noun, but \"overcame\" is a verb. \"Overcame\" means to conquer, so that's closer to the action of defeating. But the original word is \"succumbed,\" which is a past tense of \"succumb,\" so the antonym might be \"overcame\" as a verb. However, \"overcame\" is more about conquering than resisting. \n\nSo between \"resisted\" and \"stood firm,\" which are more direct antonyms. \"Stood firm\" is a bit more idiomatic. \"Resisted\" is more common. So maybe the antonyms are \"resisted\" and \"stood firm\". But the user wants maximum 2, so I can list them as two. Wait, the user said \"antonyms (maximum 2)\". So if there are two, list them. But maybe \"overcame\" is also a valid antonym. Let me check a dictionary. \n\nLooking up \"succumbed\" antonyms: \"resisted\", \"stood\", \"overcame\". So \"overcame\" is a valid antonym. But \"overcame\" is more about defeating, while \"succumbed\" is about giving in. So \"overcame\" is the opposite in meaning. So maybe \"overcame\" and \"resisted\" are both antonyms. But the user might expect \"resisted\" and \"stood firm\". Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, \"survived\" is an antonym, but that's more about surviving rather than resisting. So maybe \"resisted\" and \"overcame\" are better. But the user might expect \"resisted\" and \"stood firm\". I need to decide which are the most accurate. \n\nIn standard dictionaries, \"resisted\" is an antonym. \"Overcame\" is also an antonym. \"Stood firm\" is more of a phrasal verb. So perhaps the correct antonyms are \"resisted\" and \"overcame\". But the user might want the most direct ones. \n\nAlternatively, \"stood firm\" is a bit more specific. So maybe the answer is \"resisted; overcame\". But I need to confirm. Let me check a thesaurus. \n\nYes, \"resisted\" and \"overcame\" are both antonyms. So the answer should be \"resisted; overcame\".\n...done thinking.\n\nresisted; overcame"
