  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"equate\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"equate\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"equate\" means. The verb \"equate\" means to make equal or equivalent, so as a noun, it would refer to the act of equating things.\n\nNow, I need to find the antonyms. Antonyms are words that have the opposite meaning. For \"equate\", the opposite would be something like \"disparage\" or \"distinguish\". Wait, but \"disparage\" is more about贬低, which is different. Let me think again. The noun form of \"equate\" is \"equation\", but the user is asking for antonyms of \"equate\" as a noun. So maybe the antonyms are words that are opposite in meaning to the action of equating.\n\nCommon antonyms for \"equate\" (verb) would be \"disparage\" or \"distinguish\". But since the user specified the noun form, maybe \"equation\" is the noun, and the antonyms would be words that are opposite to the concept of equating. However, \"equation\" is a different word. Wait, the user wrote \"equate\" as a noun, so maybe they are looking for antonyms of the noun \"equation\". But the original word is \"equate\" as a verb. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the user wrote \"Given the following word 'equate'(noun).\" So they are referring to the noun form of \"equate\". The noun form is \"equation\". So the antonyms of \"equation\" would be words that are opposite to an equation. For example, \"dispute\", \"dissociate\", \"dissolve\", etc. But I need to be precise.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is referring to the verb \"equate\" as a noun, but that's not standard. The noun form of \"equate\" is \"equation\". So the antonyms of \"equation\" would be words that are not equal or not equivalent. So possible antonyms are \"dispute\", \"dissociate\", \"dissolve\", \"dissociate\", \"dissolve\". But I need to pick the most relevant ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the verb \"equate\" and wants antonyms for that. But the user specified the noun form. So I need to focus on the noun \"equation\" and find antonyms. The antonyms of \"equation\" would be things that are not equal or not equivalent. So \"dispute\", \"dissociate\", \"dissolve\", \"dissociate\", \"dissolve\". But the user wants maximum 2 antonyms. So maybe \"dispute\" and \"dissociate\" are the top ones. But I need to check if those are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the antonyms are \"disparage\" and \"distinguish\". But I'm not sure. Since the user is asking for antonyms of the noun \"equation\", which is a different word, I should focus on that. So the antonyms would be words that are opposite to an equation. For example, \"dispute\" (to question), \"dissociate\" (to separate), \"dissolve\" (to break apart). But the most common antonym for an equation might be \"dispute\" or \"dissociate\". However, \"dissociate\" is more about separating parts, while \"dispute\" is about questioning. So maybe \"dispute\" and \"dissociate\" are the best choices.\n\nBut the user wants maximum 2 antonyms. So I'll list them as \"dispute; dissociate\".\n...done thinking.\n\ndispute;dissociate"
