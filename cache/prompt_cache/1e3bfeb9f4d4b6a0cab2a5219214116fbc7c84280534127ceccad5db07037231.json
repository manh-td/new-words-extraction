  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bohemian\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user wants the antonyms of \"bohemian\" as a noun. First, I need to recall what a bohemian is. A bohemian is someone who lives a bohemian lifestyle, which means they are unconventional, maybe artists or writers, not conforming to societal norms. So antonyms would be words that contrast with this.\n\nCommon antonyms for bohemian might be \"conformist\" or \"traditionalist\" because they oppose the unconventional lifestyle. But wait, the user specified \"noun\" so maybe \"conformist\" is better. Another possible antonym is \"sociable\" but that's more about being social rather than opposing the bohemian lifestyle. Let me check again. \"Conformist\" fits better as it's about adhering to societal norms, which is opposite of a bohemian's non-conformity. \"Traditionalist\" is also a possible antonym, but maybe \"conformist\" is more direct. So the two antonyms would be conformist and traditionalist. But the user wants maximum two, so I can list them as conformist;traditionalist. Wait, but maybe \"sociable\" isn't a direct antonym. Let me confirm. Yes, \"conformist\" is more accurate here. So the answer should be conformist;traditionalist.\n...done thinking.\n\nconformist;traditionalist"
