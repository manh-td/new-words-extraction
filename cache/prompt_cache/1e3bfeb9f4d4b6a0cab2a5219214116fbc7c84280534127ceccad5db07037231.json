  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bohemian\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for the antonyms of \"bohemian\" (noun). Let me think. A bohemian is someone who lives a bohemian life, which means they're free-spirited, not conforming to societal norms, maybe wandering around, not settled. So antonyms would be things that contrast with that.\n\nWords like \"conformist\" come to mind because they follow rules. Then \"establishment\" because bohemians don't belong there. Wait, but the user wants antonyms, so maybe \"conformist\" and \"establishment\"? Or is there a better fit?\n\nAnother thought: \"settled\" might be an antonym, but the user specified noun. \"Establishment\" is a noun, so that's good. \"Conformist\" is also a noun. So the two antonyms would be conformist and establishment. Let me check if those are correct. Yes, conformist refers to someone who follows rules, and establishment refers to the traditional or formal society. So those should be the answers.\n...done thinking.\n\nconformist; establishment"
