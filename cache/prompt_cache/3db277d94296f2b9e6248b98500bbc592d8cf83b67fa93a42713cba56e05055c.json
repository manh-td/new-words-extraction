  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"lucrative\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"lucrative\" (an adjective). Let me think. First, I need to recall what \"lucrative\" means. It describes something that brings in a lot of money or is profitable. So synonyms would be words that mean something valuable or profitable.\n\nHmm, \"profitable\" comes to mind. That's a direct synonym. Then there's \"remunerative,\" which also means providing payment or compensation, which fits. Are there any others? \"Gainful\" might work, but I think \"profitable\" and \"remunerative\" are the most common ones. Let me check if \"remunerative\" is considered a synonym here. Yes, it's often used in the context of something that pays well. So the two synonyms would be \"profitable\" and \"remunerative.\" I should present them separated by semicolons as instructed.\n...done thinking.\n\nprofitable; remunerative"
