  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"lucrative\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"lucrative\" (an adjective). Let me think about what synonyms I know. \"Lucrative\" means bringing profit or being profitable. So, words that mean profitable or yielding profit.\n\nFirst, \"profitable\" comes to mind. That's a direct synonym. Then there's \"profit-making,\" which also means capable of generating profit. But I need to check if \"profit-making\" is considered an adjective here. Sometimes, it's used as a noun, but in this context, maybe it's acceptable as an adjective. \n\nWait, the user specified \"adjective,\" so I should make sure both are adjectives. \"Profitable\" is definitely an adjective. \"Profit-making\" is more of a noun, but sometimes it can be used as an adjective. However, maybe the more common synonym is \"profitable.\" \n\nAnother option could be \"generous,\" but that's more about giving than earning profit. So probably not. \"Pleasant\" doesn't fit. \"Bountiful\" means abundant, which isn't exactly about profit. \n\nSo the best synonyms are \"profitable\" and \"profit-making.\" But I need to check if \"profit-making\" is considered an adjective here. Since the user wants synonyms, and both are adjectives, I can include both. But maybe the user expects the more commonly used one. Alternatively, \"profitable\" is more standard. \n\nWait, \"profitable\" is a standard synonym. \"Profit-making\" is less common as an adjective. So the answer should be \"profitable; profitable.\" But maybe the system expects only one. Wait, the user said maximum 2, so two is okay. But maybe \"profit-making\" is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, \"generous\" isn't right. So the two synonyms are \"profitable\" and \"profit-making.\" But I need to confirm if \"profit-making\" is considered an adjective here. Since the user didn't specify, I'll go with both. However, sometimes \"profit-making\" is used as a noun, but as an adjective, it's acceptable. \n\nSo the final answer is \"profitable; profit-making.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nprofitable; profit-making"
