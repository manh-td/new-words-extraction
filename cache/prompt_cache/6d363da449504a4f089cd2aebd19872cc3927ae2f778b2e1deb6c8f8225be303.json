  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"diversions\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for antonyms of the word \"diversions\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Diversions\" means things that distract or entertain, like activities that take away attention from something else. So, antonyms would be things that are not distractions or that are not entertaining.\n\nPossible antonyms could be things like \"focus\" because focusing is the opposite of diverting. Another one might be \"concentration\" since that's about being focused. Wait, but the user specified \"antonyms\" and wants them in a string separated by semicolons. Let me check if there are more. \n\nAnother possible antonym is \"attention,\" but that's more about the subject than the action. \"Distraction\" is a synonym, so that's not helpful. \"Distract\" is the verb, so not needed here. \"Focus\" and \"concentration\" seem like good antonyms. Are there any others? Maybe \"attention\" but that's a noun. So the two best antonyms are focus and concentration. Let me confirm. Yes, those are the most direct opposites. So the answer should be \"focus; concentration\".\n...done thinking.\n\nfocus; concentration"
