  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"diversions\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the word \"diversions\" as a noun and asked for antonyms. First, I need to recall what the antonyms are for \"diversions.\" \n\n\"Diversions\" means actions or activities designed to entertain or distract someone. So, antonyms would be things that are not distractions or entertainments. Words like \"boredom\" come to mind because that's the state of being bored, which is the opposite of being entertained. Another antonym might be \"monotony,\" which refers to something that is boring or uninteresting. \n\nWait, but the user wants antonyms for the noun. So \"boredom\" is a state, but maybe \"monotony\" is more directly an antonym in the sense of being uninteresting. Alternatively, \"dullness\" could work. But I need to check if those are considered antonyms here. \n\nAnother possibility is \"suffering,\" but that's more about the negative effect rather than the opposite of the action. So maybe \"boredom\" and \"monotony\" are the best choices. Let me confirm. \n\nYes, \"boredom\" and \"monotony\" are antonyms for \"diversions\" as they contrast with the purpose of diverting attention. So the answer should be those two, joined by a semicolon.\n...done thinking.\n\nboredom; monotony"
