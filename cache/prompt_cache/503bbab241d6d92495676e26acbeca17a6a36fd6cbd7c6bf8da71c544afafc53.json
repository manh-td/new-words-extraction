  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"deviating\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for antonyms of the word \"deviating\" as a verb. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"deviating\" means. It's a verb that means to move or change direction, or to become more and more different. So, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite.\n\nThe opposite of \"deviating\" would be something that doesn't change direction, stays the same. So, maybe \"still\" or \"fixed\"? Wait, \"still\" is more about not moving, while \"fixed\" might be more about not changing. But \"fixed\" is more like a physical state. \n\nAnother possibility is \"stationary\", but that's more about not moving. However, the user might prefer more common words. \"Still\" is a common antonym. \"Fixed\" is also a possible one. Let me check if those are accurate.\n\nAlternatively, \"unchanging\" could be an antonym, but that's an adjective. The user asked for antonyms, so maybe \"still\" and \"fixed\" are better. But \"fixed\" is more about not changing, while \"still\" is about not moving. Both could work. \n\nSo the answer should be \"still; fixed\" or \"still; fixed\". Wait, the user said maximum 2, so two antonyms. Let me confirm. Yes, \"still\" and \"fixed\" are both antonyms. So the final answer is those two.\n...done thinking.\n\nstill; fixed"
