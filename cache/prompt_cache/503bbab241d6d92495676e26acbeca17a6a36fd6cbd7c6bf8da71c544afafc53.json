  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"deviating\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"deviating\" (verb). First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Deviating\" means moving or changing direction, so antonyms would be things that don't change direction, like staying still or not moving.\n\nHmm, what are the direct antonyms? \"Staying\" comes to mind because if something is staying still, it's not deviating. Then \"stationary\" is another strong antonym since it's not moving at all. Are there any others? \"Fixed\" might work too, but \"fixed\" is more about being in a state rather than movement. \"Static\" is similar to stationary. But the user asked for maximum two, so maybe stick with the most precise ones.\n\nWait, \"stationary\" is a noun, but the original word is a verb. Maybe \"stationary\" is acceptable here. Alternatively, \"still\" as a noun, but maybe the user expects more formal terms. Let me check. \"Still\" is a common antonym for moving. So maybe \"still\" and \"stationary\" are the best choices. But the user said maximum two, so I can list them as two. Let me confirm: \"still\" means not moving, and \"stationary\" means not moving. Both are valid antonyms. So the answer should be \"still; stationary\".\n...done thinking.\n\nstill; stationary"
