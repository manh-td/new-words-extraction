  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"menial\" (an adjective). Let me think. Menial means serving or doing menial tasks. So synonyms could be things like servant, assistant, or helper. But I need to make sure they are adjectives. \"Servant\" is an adjective, \"assistant\" is also an adjective, and \"helper\" is another one. Wait, but maybe \"servant\" is more formal. Let me check. Yes, \"menial\" can also mean a servant or a helper. So the best synonyms would be servant and assistant. But I should check if \"helper\" is considered a synonym here. Hmm, maybe \"assistant\" is more accurate. So the answer should be servant; assistant. Let me confirm. Yes, those are the common synonyms for menial as an adjective.\n...done thinking.\n\nservant; assistant"
