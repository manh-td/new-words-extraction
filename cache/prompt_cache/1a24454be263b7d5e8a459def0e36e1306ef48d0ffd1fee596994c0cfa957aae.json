  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"patriarchal\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to provide two example sentences using the word \"patriarchal\" as an adjective. Let me think about how to use it correctly.\n\nFirst, \"patriarchal\" refers to relating to a patriarch, which is a male head of a family or a religious group. So, I need sentences that show that. Maybe something about family structures or religious institutions.\n\nSentence 1: A patriarchal family structure emphasizes the role of the father as the head. That's straightforward. \n\nSentence 2: The church's teachings are based on a patriarchal interpretation of the Bible. That shows the religious context. \n\nWait, are these sentences accurate? Let me check. Yes, \"patriarchal\" can describe both family and religious contexts. I should make sure the examples are correct and not too generic. Maybe add some details to make them more specific. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use a different context. Like a society or a legal system. But the examples I have seem good. Let me stick with the family and religious contexts. \n\nSo the final answer would be those two sentences. No need for explanations, just the sentences in the required format.\n...done thinking.\n\npatriarchal family structure emphasizes the role of the father as the head; the church's teachings are based on a patriarchal interpretation of the Bible."
