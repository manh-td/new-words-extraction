  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"complacency\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"complacency\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what complacency means. Complacency is a state of being satisfied with one's situation, often to the point of neglecting to improve it. So, antonyms would be things that contrast with that state of satisfaction.\n\nThinking of words that mean the opposite of being satisfied or content. Words like \"restlessness\" come to mind because if you're not satisfied, you might be restless. Then there's \"despair\" because if you're complacent, maybe you're not striving towards something better, leading to despair. Wait, but despair is more about hopelessness, not necessarily the lack of satisfaction. Hmm.\n\nAnother possibility is \"doubt\" but that's more about uncertainty. Maybe \"anxiety\" as well? No, that's more about worry. Let me think again. \"Restlessness\" and \"despair\" seem stronger. Are there others? \"Neglect\" is a verb, but maybe \"negation\" as a noun? Not sure. Maybe \"despondency\" is a stronger antonym. But the user asked for maximum two, so maybe \"restlessness\" and \"despair\" are the best choices. Let me check if those are correct. Yes, restlessness refers to the state of being restless, which contrasts with complacency. Despair is a more intense emotion, but it's still a valid antonym. So the answer should be \"restlessness; despair\".\n...done thinking.\n\nrestlessness; despair"
