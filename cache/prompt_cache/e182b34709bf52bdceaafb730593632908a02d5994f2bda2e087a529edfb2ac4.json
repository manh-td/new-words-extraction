  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"complacency\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what complacency means. Complacency is a state of being satisfied with one's situation, often to the point of being unaware of the problems or dangers that exist. So, antonyms would be words that contrast with this state of satisfaction.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean the opposite of being complacent. Words like \"awareness\" come to mind because they imply knowing about the problems. Another possible antonym is \"consciousness,\" but that might be too broad. \"Doubt\" is another possibility, but that's more about uncertainty rather than the state of being complacent. \n\nWait, \"awareness\" is more directly opposite. \"Doubt\" might not be the best fit here. Let me check if there are other common antonyms. \"Criticism\" is a noun, but it's more about pointing out faults. \"Neglect\" could be a possible antonym, but that's more about not paying attention. \n\nSo the most accurate antonyms here are \"awareness\" and \"doubt.\" But I need to make sure. \"Doubt\" might not be the best fit because it's about uncertainty, whereas \"awareness\" is about knowing the situation. However, \"doubt\" can sometimes be used in the context of being complacent, but I think \"awareness\" is more direct. \n\nAlternatively, \"consciousness\" is another option, but it's less common. The user asked for maximum two antonyms, so I can list them as \"awareness; consciousness.\" But maybe \"doubt\" is better. Wait, the user might expect \"doubt\" as an antonym. Hmm. \n\nI think the best antonyms are \"awareness\" and \"doubt.\" But I need to confirm. Let me think again. Complacency is about being satisfied without awareness of the problem. So antonyms would be words that indicate awareness or the opposite state. \"Awareness\" is a direct antonym. \"Doubt\" is more about uncertainty, but maybe not the exact antonym. \n\nAlternatively, \"criticism\" is a noun, but it's more about pointing out faults. \"Neglect\" is about not paying attention. So maybe \"awareness\" and \"doubt\" are the best choices. But I need to check if \"doubt\" is considered an antonym here. \n\nAlternatively, \"consciousness\" is a better antonym. So maybe the answer is \"awareness; consciousness.\" But I'm not sure. The user might expect \"awareness\" and \"doubt.\" However, I should stick to the most accurate antonyms. \n\nAfter considering, the most accurate antonyms are \"awareness\" and \"doubt.\" So the answer would be \"awareness; doubt.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nawareness;doubt"
