  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"uncanny\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences using the word \"uncanny\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Uncanny\" as a noun means something strange or eerie, often causing a sense of wonder or fear.\n\nSo, possible sentences could be things like \"The old house was uncanny in its quietness.\" Or maybe \"The phenomenon was uncanny, leaving everyone in awe.\" Wait, but the user specified \"noun,\" so I need to ensure the sentences use it as a noun. Let me check. \"Uncanny\" can be a noun, like \"an uncanny experience.\" \n\nAnother example: \"The forest was uncanny in its beauty.\" Hmm, but maybe that's not the most common usage. Let me think of more natural sentences. Maybe \"The ghostly apparition was uncanny in its presence.\" Or \"The strange occurrences were uncanny, making the guests uneasy.\" \n\nI need to keep it concise, max two sentences. Let me pick two that are clear and correct. First sentence: \"The old house was uncanny in its quietness.\" Second sentence: \"The phenomenon was uncanny, leaving everyone in awe.\" Yeah, that works. They both use \"uncanny\" as a noun and are grammatically correct.\n...done thinking.\n\nuncanny; the old house was uncanny in its quietness; the phenomenon was uncanny, leaving everyone in awe"
