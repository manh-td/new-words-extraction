  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"transfixed\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"transfixed\" (an adjective). Let me start by recalling what \"transfixed\" means. It means to be so deeply impressed or amazed that one is unable to move or think clearly. So, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of being deeply impressed or amazed.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean the opposite of being fixed or impressed. Words like \"unaffected\" come to mind because if someone is unaffected, they aren't really impressed. Another possible antonym is \"disinterested,\" but wait, that's more about being impartial than being impressed. Maybe \"unimpressed\" is a better antonym because it directly contrasts with being impressed. \n\nWait, the user specified \"antonyms\" and wants them in a string separated by semicolons. Let me check if there are multiple correct answers. \"Unaffected\" and \"unimpressed\" are both valid antonyms. Are there any others? \"Unmoved\" could work too, as in not being moved by something. But I need to make sure which ones are most accurate. \n\n\"Unaffected\" is a direct antonym, and \"unimpressed\" is also correct. \"Unmoved\" might be less common in this context. So, the best antonyms would be \"unaffected\" and \"unimpressed\". Let me confirm that these are indeed antonyms. Yes, \"unaffected\" means not showing emotion, which aligns with the opposite of being transfixed. \"Unimpressed\" means not being impressed, which is exactly what \"transfixed\" is opposite of. \n\nSo the answer should be \"unaffected; unimpressed\".\n...done thinking.\n\nunaffected; unimpressed"
