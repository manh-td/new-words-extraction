  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"transfixed\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"transfixed\" (an adjective). Let me start by recalling what \"transfixed\" means. It means to be so completely absorbed or impressed that one is unable to move or think. So, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of being deeply impressed or absorbed.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean the opposite. Words like \"unimpressed\" come to mind, but that's more of an adverb. Maybe \"disinterested\"? Wait, \"disinterested\" means not having any bias, which is a bit different. Then there's \"unaffected,\" which means not showing emotion. But does that fit exactly with \"transfixed\"? \n\nAnother possibility is \"distracted,\" but that's more about being divided attention. \"Distracted\" might not be the exact antonym. \"Unfocused\" could work, but that's more about lack of concentration. \n\nWait, \"disillusioned\" is more about losing belief. \"Unimpressed\" is closer. \"Unaffected\" is also a good one. So, the two strongest antonyms might be \"unimpressed\" and \"unaffected.\" But I need to check if these are correct. \n\nAlternatively, \"disinterested\" is sometimes used in contexts where someone is not emotionally involved. But \"transfixed\" is more about being completely absorbed. So \"disinterested\" might not be the best. \n\nHmm, maybe \"unaffected\" is better. Let me verify. \"Unaffected\" means not showing emotion, which could be the opposite of being transfixed. \"Unimpressed\" is also a good antonym. So the two antonyms would be \"unimpressed\" and \"unaffected.\" \n\nBut the user asked for maximum two, so I can list them as such. I should check if there are any other common antonyms. \"Distracted\" is sometimes used, but I think \"unimpressed\" and \"unaffected\" are more accurate. So the answer should be those two.\n...done thinking.\n\nunimpressed; unaffected"
