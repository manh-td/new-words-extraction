  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"maneuvers\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for antonyms of the word \"maneuvers\" when used as a verb. First, I need to make sure I understand the correct meaning of \"maneuvers\" in this context. It's a verb, so it refers to the act of moving or guiding something, like in military or tactical situations.\n\nNow, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. So, what are the opposite actions of maneuvering? Maybe something like \"stagnation\" or \"inaction\"? Wait, but \"stagnation\" is more about being stuck, not the opposite of moving. Maybe \"static\" or \"fixed\"? Hmm, not quite. \n\nAnother angle: in military terms, maneuvers could be planned movements. The antonym might be \"static\" or \"inert\". But I need to check if those are commonly used. \"Static\" means not moving, which could fit. \"Inert\" means not active, which might also work. \n\nWait, the user wants antonyms, so I need to list the most appropriate ones. \"Static\" and \"inert\" are both valid. But maybe \"still\" is another option? However, \"still\" is more about being not moving, but \"static\" is more about being unchanging. \n\nAlternatively, \"inaction\" is a possible antonym, but that's more about not doing anything. Maybe \"inaction\" is too broad. \n\nSo, the best antonyms here are \"static\" and \"inert\". Let me confirm. In military contexts, \"static\" refers to being stationary, which is the opposite of maneuvering. \"Inert\" means not active, which could apply to a lack of movement. \n\nYes, those are the most accurate antonyms. So the answer should be \"static; inert\".\n...done thinking.\n\nstatic; inert"
