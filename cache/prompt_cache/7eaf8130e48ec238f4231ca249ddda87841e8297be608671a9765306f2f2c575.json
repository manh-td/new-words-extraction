  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"maneuvers\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"maneuvers\" when used as a verb. Let me start by understanding the word \"maneuvers\" in this context. It means to move something carefully and skillfully, often in a strategic or tactical way. So, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of moving carefully and skillfully.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean the opposite of moving. The direct antonyms might be something like \"static\" or \"fixed,\" but that's more about being unmoving. However, the context here is about movement, so maybe \"static\" is a good fit. Another possible antonym could be \"inert,\" which means not moving. But \"inert\" is more about being unresponsive, not necessarily about movement.\n\nWait, the user specified \"maneuvers\" as a verb, so maybe the antonyms are more about the action of moving. So \"static\" or \"fixed\" could work. But I need to check if there are more accurate antonyms. Another possibility is \"stalemate,\" but that's more about a situation where both sides are stuck, not about movement. \n\nAlternatively, \"inert\" might be a better antonym because it directly relates to not moving. But \"static\" is also a good one. So combining both, the antonyms would be \"static\" and \"inert.\" But the user asked for maximum two, so I can list them as such. Let me make sure there's no better term. Maybe \"stagnant\" but that's more about being unmoving due to lack of movement. Hmm. \n\nSo the most accurate antonyms here are \"static\" and \"inert.\" I'll go with those.\n...done thinking.\n\nstatic; inert"
