  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"stifled\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"stifled\" as an adjective. Let me start by recalling what \"stifled\" means. It means to suppress or prevent something from happening, often in a way that's forceful or restrictive.\n\nSo, I need to think of other adjectives that have similar meanings. Words like \"restrained\" come to mind because they mean controlled or limited. Another possible synonym is \"suppressed,\" which also means to prevent something from occurring, often through force or neglect.\n\nWait, let me double-check if \"restrained\" is indeed an adjective. Yes, it is. And \"suppressed\" is also an adjective. Are there any others? Maybe \"held back\"? But that's more of a verb. \"Caged\" is an adjective, but it's less common. \"Tamed\" is another possibility, but that's more about making something less aggressive. \n\nSo the best synonyms here are \"restrained\" and \"suppressed.\" I should present them as the answer, joined by semicolons. Let me make sure there's no mistake. Yep, those are the standard synonyms for \"stifled\" as an adjective.\n...done thinking.\n\nrestrained; suppressed"
