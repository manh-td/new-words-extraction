  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"stifled\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for synonyms of the word \"stifled\" as an adjective. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Stifled\" means to suppress or prevent something from moving or expressing itself, often in a way that's quiet or restrained.\n\nNow, thinking of synonyms. The most common ones that come to mind are \"restrained\" and \"silenced.\" Wait, \"restrained\" is more about controlling without necessarily stopping, while \"silenced\" is more about preventing speech. But both can be used as adjectives. Another possibility might be \"checked,\" but that's more about stopping movement. Let me check if those are accurate.\n\n\"Restrained\" is definitely an adjective meaning controlled or limited. \"Silenced\" is also an adjective meaning made silent, which fits. \"Checked\" could work too, but maybe the user wants more precise synonyms. So the top two would be \"restrained\" and \"silenced.\" I should make sure there's no other common synonyms. \"Suppressed\" is another one, but that's more about suppressing something, like a feeling or idea. So maybe \"restrained\" and \"silenced\" are the best choices here. Let me confirm by recalling standard dictionaries. Yes, those are standard synonyms. So the answer should be those two.\n...done thinking.\n\nrestrained;silenced"
