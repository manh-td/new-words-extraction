  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"maneuvers\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for antonyms of \"maneuvers\" as a noun. Let me think. Maneuvers usually mean a series of actions or movements, like in military or sports. So antonyms would be things that are not actions or movements. Words like \"static\" or \"inert\" come to mind because they describe something that's not moving. But wait, \"static\" is more about being stationary, while \"inert\" means not moving. Both are antonyms. Are there any others? Maybe \"still\" or \"fixed\"? But \"still\" is more about not moving, and \"fixed\" is about being in a specific position. However, the user asked for maximum two, so I can pick the most appropriate. \"Static\" and \"inert\" are both good. Let me check if they are commonly used as antonyms. Yes, in the context of maneuvers, these words make sense. So the answer should be static;inert.\n...done thinking.\n\nstatic;inert"
