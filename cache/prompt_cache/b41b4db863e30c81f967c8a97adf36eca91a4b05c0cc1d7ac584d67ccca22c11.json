  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"maneuvers\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"maneuvers\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"maneuvers\" means. It refers to the actions or movements made by a person or group, especially in a military or tactical context. So, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of actions or movements.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean the opposite of actions. Words like \"standstill\" come to mind, but that's more about a state than actions. Then there's \"inaction,\" which directly contrasts with action. Another possibility is \"idleness,\" but that's more about being inactive. \n\nWait, the user specified \"antonyms\" for \"maneuvers\" as a noun. So, maybe \"standstill\" is not the best fit. Let me think again. The opposite of \"maneuvers\" could be \"static\" or \"inaction,\" but \"inaction\" is more about not doing anything. \"Static\" might be more about being unmoving. \n\nAnother angle: in military terms, \"maneuvers\" could refer to coordinated movements. So antonyms might be \"static\" or \"inaction.\" But I need to check if these are standard antonyms. \"Static\" is a possible antonym, but maybe \"inaction\" is more direct. \n\nAlternatively, \"standstill\" is a common antonym for \"movement.\" So combining these, the antonyms could be \"inaction\" and \"standstill.\" But the user wants maximum two, so maybe those two. Let me confirm. \n\nYes, \"inaction\" and \"standstill\" are both antonyms. So the answer should be \"inaction; standstill.\"\n...done thinking.\n\ninaction; standstill"
