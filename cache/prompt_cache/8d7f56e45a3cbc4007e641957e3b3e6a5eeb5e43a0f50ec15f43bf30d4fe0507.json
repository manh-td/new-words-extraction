  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"grain\"(verb).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to provide two example sentences using the verb \"grain\" from the dictionary. Let me think about the correct usage.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the verb correctly. \"Grain\" as a verb means to break down something, like grains of rice. So possible sentences could be something like \"She grains the wheat to make flour\" or \"He grains the seeds to plant them.\"\n\nWait, I should check if there are other common uses. Maybe \"grain\" can also mean to make into a powder, like \"grain the herbs.\" But the user might be looking for the most common usage. Let me stick with the first example.\n\nAnother sentence could be \"The farmer grains the grain to feed his livestock.\" That uses \"grain\" as in breaking down grains. I need to make sure the sentences are correct and concise. Let me verify the verbs. \"Grain\" is indeed a verb meaning to break down, so those examples should work. Alright, I think that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\ngrain the wheat to make flour; grain the seeds to plant them"
