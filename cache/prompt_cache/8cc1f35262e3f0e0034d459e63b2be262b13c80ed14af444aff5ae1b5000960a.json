  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"stifled\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"stifled\" (verb). First, I need to recall what the opposite of \"stifled\" means. \"Stifled\" means to suppress or prevent something from happening, usually by force or restriction.\n\nSo, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite. Words like \"freed\" or \"unstifled\" come to mind. But wait, \"freed\" is more of a noun or adjective, while \"unstifled\" is an adjective. However, \"unstifled\" is a valid adjective meaning not stifled. \n\nAnother possible antonym could be \"unrestrained,\" but that's more about lack of control rather than suppression. \"Unstifled\" seems more direct. Let me check if there are other options. \"Unstifled\" and \"freed\" are the main ones. So the answer should be \"unstifled; freed\". But I need to make sure there are no other common antonyms. Maybe \"unconstrained\"? But that's more about not being restricted. \"Unstifled\" is more about the state of not being stifled. So the correct antonyms are \"unstifled\" and \"freed\".\n...done thinking.\n\nunstifled; freed"
