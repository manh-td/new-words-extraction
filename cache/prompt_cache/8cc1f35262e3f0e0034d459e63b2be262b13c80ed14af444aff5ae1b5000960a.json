  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"stifled\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"stifled\" as a verb. Let me start by recalling what \"stifled\" means. The verb \"stifle\" means to suppress or prevent something from happening, often in a way that stops it from being expressed or done.\n\nSo, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of suppressing or preventing. Let me think. Words like \"free\" come to mind because they mean to allow something to happen without restriction. Another one could be \"unstifled,\" but that's more of a noun or a verb form. Wait, \"unstifled\" is an adjective, so maybe that's not the best antonym. \n\nAnother possible antonym is \"unrestrained,\" but that's more about not being controlled. \"Unconstrained\" might also work, but I need to check if those are accurate. \n\nWait, \"unstifled\" as an adjective would mean not stifled, so maybe that's a good antonym. But the user wants antonyms for the verb \"stifled,\" so maybe \"unstifled\" is the direct antonym. However, \"unstifled\" is more of a noun or adjective. \n\nAlternatively, \"free\" is a common antonym for stifled. So, \"free\" and \"unstifled\" could be the antonyms. But I need to make sure. Let me verify. \n\nYes, \"free\" means to allow something to happen without restriction, which is the opposite of stifling. \"Unstifled\" is the opposite of stifled, so that's another antonym. So the two antonyms would be \"free\" and \"unstifled.\" But the user wants the maximum of two, so I can list them as such. \n\nWait, but \"unstifled\" is more of a noun or adjective, so maybe \"free\" is better as an antonym. Alternatively, \"unstifled\" as a verb form? Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, \"unstifled\" could be the adjective form, so the antonym would be \"unstifled\" and \"free.\" But maybe the user expects \"free\" and \"unstifled\" as the antonyms. \n\nI think the correct antonyms are \"free\" and \"unstifled.\" So the answer should be \"free; unstifled.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nfree; unstifled"
