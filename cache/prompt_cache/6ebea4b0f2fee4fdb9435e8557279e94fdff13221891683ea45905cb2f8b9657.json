  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"menial\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to provide two example sentences using the word \"menial\" as an adjective. Let me think about how to use it correctly.\n\nFirst, \"menial\" means serving someone, like a servant. So maybe something like \"The menial helped clean the office.\" That's straightforward. \n\nAnother example could be \"She was promoted to a menial position after years of hard work.\" Wait, \"menial\" is an adjective, so the sentence should be \"The menial was promoted...\" Yeah, that works. \n\nI need to make sure both sentences are correct and use the word properly. Let me check if \"menial\" is indeed an adjective. Yes, it's an adjective meaning a servant or a person who does menial tasks. \n\nSo the first sentence: \"The menial helped clean the office.\" Second sentence: \"The menial was promoted to a menial position after years of hard work.\" \n\nWait, the second sentence might be a bit awkward. Maybe \"menial position\" is correct, but \"menial\" as an adjective. Yes, it's acceptable. \n\nI think that's it. Both sentences are correct and use the word properly.\n...done thinking.\n\nThe menial helped clean the office; The menial was promoted to a menial position after years of hard work."
