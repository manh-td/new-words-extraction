  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"menial\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to create two short example sentences using the word \"menial\" as an adjective. Let me think about the right contexts.\n\nFirst, \"menial\" means a servant or a helper. So maybe something like a menial worker in a household. That's straightforward. Then, maybe another context where it's used in a more formal or literary way. Like a menial in a company setting. Wait, but the user specified \"adjective,\" so the sentences should be adjectives. \n\nWait, the word is an adjective, so the sentences should be using it as an adjective. So examples like \"The menial helped with the chores\" or \"She was a menial in the office.\" But I need to make sure the sentences are correct. Let me check. \"Menial\" as an adjective: \"The menial worker was very diligent.\" Or \"The menial was assigned to clean the office.\" \n\nHmm, maybe the first example is better. Let me make sure the sentences are correct and not too trivial. Also, the user wants maximum two sentences. So I'll go with those two.\n...done thinking.\n\nmenial worker helped clean the office; the menial was assigned to assist with daily tasks."
