  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"notary\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to create two example sentences using the word \"notary\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. A notary is someone who handles legal documents, like signing contracts or witnessing signatures. So, the sentences should reflect that role.\n\nMaybe start with a scenario where a notary is involved in a legal transaction. Like, a lawyer hiring a notary to sign a document. Then another example where a notary is involved in a legal event, such as a wedding. That covers both professional and personal contexts. I should check if the sentences are correct and concise. Also, ensure that the format is exactly as specified, no JSON or explanation. Just two sentences separated by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\nnotary signed the documents for the marriage; the notary ensured all legal forms were properly completed."
