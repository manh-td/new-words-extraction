  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences using the word \"notary\" as a noun. Let me think of two sentences. First, maybe something about a legal professional. Like, \"The notary public signed the contract.\" Then another one could be about a company employing a notary. \"The company hired a notary to handle legal documents.\" I need to make sure they're correct and concise. Check if \"notary\" is indeed a noun here. Yes, it's a person who handles notarizations. Alright, that should work.\n...done thinking.\n\nThe notary public signed the contract; the notary handled the legal documents for the company."
