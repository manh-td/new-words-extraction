  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"eroded\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"eroded\" as an adjective. Let me think. First, I need to recall what \"eroded\" means. It's an adjective that describes something that has been worn away by erosion, like by water or wind.\n\nSo synonyms for erosion would be words like worn, worn away, or abraded. But wait, the user specified \"eroded\" as an adjective. So maybe \"eroded\" is a verb, but the user is asking for its adjective form. Let me check.\n\nThe adjective form of \"erode\" is \"eroded.\" So synonyms for \"eroded\" as an adjective would be words that mean the same thing. Common synonyms for \"eroded\" as an adjective might be \"weathered\" or \"worn.\" \n\nWait, \"weathered\" is more about being exposed to the elements, which can lead to erosion. \"Worn\" is more general. \"Abraded\" is another possibility, but maybe less common. Let me verify. \n\nLooking up synonyms, \"eroded\" can also be synonyms with \"weathered,\" \"worn,\" \"abraded,\" \"scoured,\" \"eroded,\" \"eroded.\" But the user wants maximum two synonyms. So between \"weathered\" and \"worn,\" which is more accurate? \"Weathered\" is more specific to erosion, while \"worn\" is more general. \n\nSo the best synonyms would be \"weathered\" and \"worn.\" But I need to check if \"worn\" is considered a synonym here. Alternatively, \"abraded\" might be another option. But maybe the user expects \"weathered\" and \"worn.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"eroded\" can also be \"scoured,\" but that's more about being washed away. So maybe \"weathered\" and \"worn\" are the best choices. Let me go with those.\n...done thinking.\n\nweathered; worn"
