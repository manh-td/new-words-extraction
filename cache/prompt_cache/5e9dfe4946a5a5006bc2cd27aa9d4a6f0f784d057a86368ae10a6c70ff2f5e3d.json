  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"equate\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"equate\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"equate\" means. The verb \"equate\" means to make equal, especially in value or importance. As a noun, it would refer to the act of equating or the state of being equated.\n\nNow, I need to think of other nouns that mean the same thing. Common synonyms for \"equate\" as a noun might include \"equivalence\" or \"equality.\" Wait, \"equivalence\" is more about the state of being equal in terms of value, while \"equality\" is about being equal in rights or status. Both are valid synonyms. Let me check if they are commonly used as nouns. Yes, \"equivalence\" is often used as a noun, and \"equality\" is also a noun. So those should be the correct synonyms. I need to make sure there aren't any other common nouns that fit. Maybe \"balance\" or \"parity\"? But those might not be as direct. \"Balance\" is more about being equal in amount, while \"parity\" refers to equality in status. Hmm, but the user specified \"equate\" as a noun, so maybe \"equivalence\" and \"equality\" are the best choices. Let me confirm by thinking of examples. If someone says \"They achieved equivalence in their salaries,\" that's correct. \"Equality\" would be \"They achieved equality in their salaries.\" Both are acceptable. So the answer should be those two, joined by a semicolon.\n...done thinking.\n\nequivalence; equality"
