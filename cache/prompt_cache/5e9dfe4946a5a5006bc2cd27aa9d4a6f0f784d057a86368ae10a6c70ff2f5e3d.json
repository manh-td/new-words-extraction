  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"equate\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"equate\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"equate\" means. The verb \"equate\" means to make equal in value, quality, or status. As a noun, it would refer to the act of equating or the state of being equated.\n\nNow, I need to think of other nouns that can replace \"equate.\" Let me brainstorm. Words like \"balance\" come to mind, but that's more about equilibrium. \"Equilibrium\" is a noun and refers to a state of balance, which is related but not exactly the same as equating. Another possibility is \"parity,\" which means equality in status or value. That seems close.\n\nWait, \"equivalence\" is also a noun and refers to the equality of two things. That's a good synonym. So, \"equivalence\" and \"parity\" are both valid nouns. Let me check if they are commonly used. \"Equivalence\" is more formal, while \"parity\" is more general. Both are acceptable. \n\nI should make sure there aren't any other common synonyms. \"Balance\" might be a contender, but it's more about equilibrium. \"Harmony\" isn't directly related. So the best synonyms are \"equivalence\" and \"parity.\" I'll present them as the answer, joined by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\nequivalence; parity"
