  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"rekindled\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"rekindled\" (verb). First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Rekindled\" means to revive or renew, especially something that was extinguished. So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of reviving or renewing.\n\nPossible antonyms could be \"dulled,\" \"dimmed,\" \"extinguished,\" or \"withdrew.\" But since the user specified maximum two antonyms, I need to pick the most relevant ones. \"Dulled\" is a direct antonym, meaning made less vibrant. \"Extinguished\" is more about putting out the fire, which fits the meaning of the original word. \"Dimmed\" is also close, but \"extinguished\" might be more precise here. Let me check if those are valid. Yes, \"extinguished\" is a standard antonym for \"rekindled.\" \"Dulled\" is also commonly used. So the two antonyms would be \"dulled\" and \"extinguished.\" I should present them as a single string separated by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\ndulled;extinguished"
