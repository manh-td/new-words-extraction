  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"rekindled\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"rekindled\" (verb). First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Rekindled\" means to revive or renew something that was previously extinguished, like a flame or a spark. So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of reviving or renewing.\n\nThinking about synonyms first might help. Words like \"rekindled\" could have antonyms like \"dulled,\" \"extinguished,\" or \"dormant.\" But the user specifically asked for antonyms, so I need to pick the most accurate ones.\n\n\"Dulled\" is a good one because it means made less bright or lively, which is opposite of being rekindled. \"Extinguished\" is also a strong antonym, as it directly means putting out the fire. \"Dormant\" could work too, but it's more about being inactive rather than the act of reviving. \n\nWait, the question says \"antonyms\" and the user wants maximum 2. So between \"dulled\" and \"extinguished,\" which is better? \"Extinguished\" is more precise because it's the direct opposite of being rekindled. \"Dulled\" is more about the state, but \"extinguished\" is the action. \n\nSo the two best antonyms would be \"extinguished\" and \"dulled.\" But I need to check if there's a more accurate one. Maybe \"dormant\" is also a possibility, but it's a bit more general. The user might prefer the direct antonyms. \n\nSo the answer should be \"extinguished;dulled\" separated by semicolons. Let me confirm that these are correct. Yes, \"extinguished\" is the opposite of rekindled, and \"dulled\" is the opposite of being rekindled. So that's the correct pair.\n...done thinking.\n\nextinguished;dulled"
