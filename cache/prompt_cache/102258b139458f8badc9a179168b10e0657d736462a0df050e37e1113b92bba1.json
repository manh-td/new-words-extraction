  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"wedlock\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"wedlock\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"wedlock\" means. It's the state of being married, right? So antonyms would be things like single, divorced, or bachelor.\n\nWait, the question specifies \"antonyms (maximum 2)\". So I can only list two. Let me think. The most direct antonyms would be \"single\" and \"divorced\". But \"divorced\" is more of a state than a noun. Hmm. The original word is a noun, so maybe \"single\" is better. Then \"bachelor\" is another common antonym. But \"bachelor\" is a noun too. So maybe \"single\" and \"bachelor\" are the two. But I need to check if \"divorced\" is acceptable. However, \"divorced\" is a noun but more commonly used in the context of a state, so maybe it's better to go with \"single\" and \"bachelor\". Let me confirm. In dictionaries, \"single\" is an adjective, but \"bachelor\" is a noun. So maybe \"single\" is the better answer here. So the antonyms would be \"single\" and \"bachelor\". But the user asked for maximum two, so that's two. So the answer should be \"single;bachelor\".\n...done thinking.\n\nsingle;bachelor"
