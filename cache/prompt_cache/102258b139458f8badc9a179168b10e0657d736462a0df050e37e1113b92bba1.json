  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"wedlock\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user wants the antonyms of the word \"wedlock\" as a noun. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"wedlock\" means. From what I know, \"wedlock\" is the act of getting married, or the state of being married. So, the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of marriage.\n\nWhat are the common antonyms for marriage? Well, \"divorce\" comes to mind because that's the opposite of marriage. Then there's \"separation,\" but that's more about ending a marriage than the act itself. Wait, but the question specifies \"wedlock\" as a noun, so maybe \"separation\" is a bit too broad. \n\nAnother possibility is \"unmarried,\" but that's an adjective. The user asked for antonyms, so maybe \"single\" or \"singlehood\" could work. But \"single\" is an adjective, while \"singlehood\" is a noun. However, \"single\" is more commonly used as an adjective. \n\nSo, between \"divorce\" and \"separation,\" which is more directly an antonym of \"wedlock\"? \"Divorce\" is the legal process of ending a marriage, while \"separation\" is a less formal term. But both are antonyms. \n\nWait, the user wants maximum 2 antonyms. So maybe \"divorce\" and \"separation\" are both valid. But I need to check if \"separation\" is considered an antonym here. Alternatively, \"single\" as an adjective might not be a noun antonym. \n\nHmm, maybe the best antonyms are \"divorce\" and \"separation.\" But I should confirm. Another angle: \"wedlock\" is the state of being married. So the antonyms would be \"single\" (as in not married) and \"divorce.\" But \"single\" is an adjective, so maybe \"unmarried\" is the antonym. But the user asked for antonyms, and \"unmarried\" is an adjective. \n\nWait, the user specified \"antonyms\" and the word is a noun. So the antonyms should be nouns. So \"divorce\" is a noun, \"separation\" is a noun, and \"single\" is an adjective. So the correct antonyms would be \"divorce\" and \"separation.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"unmarried\" as an adjective might not be considered here. So the answer should be \"divorce; separation.\"\n...done thinking.\n\ndivorce; separation"
