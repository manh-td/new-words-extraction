  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"oar\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"oar\" as a verb. Let me start by recalling what \"oar\" means. An oar is a boat paddle used to move a boat through water. As a verb, \"oar\" means to row a boat.\n\nNow, antonyms are words that have the opposite meaning. So I need to think of words that mean the opposite of rowing. Let's brainstorm. Words that mean to move a boat through water, but in the opposite direction. Maybe \"sail\" because sailing is moving a boat without using oars. But is \"sail\" considered an antonym here? Or is it a different category? Wait, \"sail\" is more about using a sail instead of oars. But maybe \"sail\" is a synonym here. Hmm.\n\nAnother possibility is \"float\" but that's more about staying afloat rather than moving. \"Propel\" could be an antonym if it means to move forward, but that's a bit different. Wait, \"propel\" is more about driving forward, which might be a bit vague. \n\nAlternatively, \"steer\" is to guide the direction, but that's not exactly the opposite of rowing. \"Cruise\" is to travel on a boat, but that's not the antonym. \n\nWait, maybe \"sail\" is the main antonym here. Because sailing is the action of moving a boat without oars. So \"sail\" would be the antonym. Are there other words? \"Boat\" is the noun, so not an antonym. \"Row\" is the verb itself, so not an antonym. \"Paddle\" is another verb, but that's similar. \n\nSo the main antonym is \"sail\". Are there any others? \"Sail\" is the most direct antonym. Maybe \"float\" but that's more about staying afloat. So I think the answer is \"sail\".\n...done thinking.\n\nsail"
