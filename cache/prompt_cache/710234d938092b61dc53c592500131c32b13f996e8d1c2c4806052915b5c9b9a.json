  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"assailed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"assailed\" (verb). Let me think. \"Assailed\" means to attack or try to attack someone or something. Synonyms could be words that mean to attack or to try to attack. Let me recall some words.\n\n\"Attacked\" is a direct synonym. Then there's \"beset\" which means to overwhelm or attack. Another option might be \"pummelled\" but that's more about being hit. \"Felled\" is to knock down, which is a bit different. \"Smitten\" means to strike suddenly, but maybe not exactly the same. \n\nSo the best ones are \"attacked\" and \"beset\". Let me check if \"beset\" is indeed a synonym. Yes, it's often used in the sense of being attacked. So the answer should be attacked; beset.\n...done thinking.\n\nattacked; beset"
