  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"assailed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants synonyms for the word \"assailed\" as a verb. Let me think. \"Assailed\" means to attack or hurt someone or something. Synonyms could be words that mean to attack or harm. Let me recall... \"Attacked\" is a direct synonym. Then there's \"hurled\" which means to throw something at someone, which is similar. Another option might be \"pounded\" but that's more about hitting with force. \"Blown\" is more about causing damage, but maybe not as direct. \"Struck\" is more general. So the best ones are \"attacked\" and \"hurled\". Let me check if \"pounded\" is acceptable. Hmm, maybe \"pounded\" is more about hitting with a heavy object. So the top two are \"attacked\" and \"hurled\". I should present them as a string separated by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\nattacked; hurled"
