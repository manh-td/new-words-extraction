Complacency means a state of being comfortable or satisfied with one's situation, often to the point of being unaware of the problems.\n\nFirst sentence: Maybe something like \"The company's success led to a sense of complacency among the employees.\" That shows how complacency can arise from success. \n\nSecond sentence: Perhaps \"She felt a strange sense of complacency after realizing she had been overpaid for years.\" Here, it's about feeling complacent despite being overpaid. \n\nI need to make sure the sentences are simple and use the word correctly. Also, check if the examples are clear and illustrate the meaning. No markdown, just plain text. Alright, that should do it.\n...done thinking.\n\ncomplacency; the feeling of being satisfied with one's situation despite potential problems; complacency; the state of being overly satisfied or indifferent to difficulties."
