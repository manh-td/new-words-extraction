  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"elitist\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences for the word \"elitist\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Elitist\" means someone who belongs to an elite group, often with a sense of superiority. As a noun, it refers to such a person.\n\nSo, I need two sentences. Let me start with the first one. Maybe something like \"The elitist politician was accused of favoring the rich.\" That shows someone in power from an elite group. \n\nFor the second sentence, perhaps something about a group. Like \"The company's elitist culture made it hard for new employees to adapt.\" That highlights the negative aspect of the noun. \n\nWait, the user said maximum two sentences. Let me check if those examples are accurate. Yes, the first sentence uses \"politician\" as the noun, and the second uses \"culture.\" Both are correct. I should format them as specified, without any extra text. Alright, that should do it.\n...done thinking.\n\nelitist politician was accused of favoring the rich; the company's elitist culture made it hard for new employees to adapt"
