  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences for the word \"elitist\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Elitist\" means someone who belongs to an elite group, often implying superiority over others. As a noun, it would refer to such a person.\n\nSo, the examples should show someone in that role. Maybe something like a person who is part of a high-class society. Let me come up with two sentences. \n\nFirst sentence: The elitist members of the club often avoid social events. Second sentence: The author's new book explores the elitist tendencies of modern society. Wait, but the user wants the word as a noun. So maybe the first sentence should be \"an elitist\" as a noun. Wait, the word given is \"elitist\" as a noun. So the examples should use the noun form. \n\nSo maybe: The elitist politician was known for their ruthless decisions. And the elitist society values education and culture highly. But I need to make sure the sentences are correct. Let me check. \n\nYes, those sentences use \"elitist\" as a noun. The first sentence uses it as a noun in the context of a person, and the second as a noun in the context of a society. That should work. I think that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nelitist politician was known for their ruthless decisions; elitist society values education and culture highly."
