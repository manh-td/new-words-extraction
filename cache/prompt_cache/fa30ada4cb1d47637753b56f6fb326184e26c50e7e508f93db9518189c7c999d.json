  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"transfixed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"transfixed\" (verb). Let me think. Transfixed means to be so impressed that one is unable to move or think. Synonyms could be things like \"bewildered\" or \"amazed.\" Wait, \"bewildered\" might be more about confusion, but \"amazed\" is closer. Another possibility is \"stupefied,\" which means to be so surprised that one is unable to move. Let me check if those are accurate. \"Stupefied\" is a good synonym. So the two synonyms would be \"amazed\" and \"stupefied.\" But I need to make sure they're correct. Alternatively, \"bewildered\" could work. Hmm. Maybe the best ones are \"amazed\" and \"stupefied.\" Let me confirm. Yes, those are standard synonyms. So the answer should be \"amazed; stupefied\".\n...done thinking.\n\namazed; stupefied"
