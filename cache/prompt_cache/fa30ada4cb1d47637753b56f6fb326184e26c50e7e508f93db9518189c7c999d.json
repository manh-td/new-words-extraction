  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"transfixed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants synonyms for the word \"transfixed\" (verb). Let me think. Transfixed means to be so completely amazed or impressed that one cannot move. Synonyms could be words that convey the same sense. Words like \"amazed\" come to mind, but that's more of an adjective. Maybe \"bewildered\"? Wait, bewildered is more about confusion. \"Stupefied\" is another possibility, meaning overwhelmed by something. \"Entranced\" also fits, as it means being completely absorbed. Let me check if these are accurate. \"Stupefied\" and \"entranced\" are both good synonyms. \"Amazed\" is an adjective, so maybe the user wants nouns? But the question says synonyms, which can include adjectives. However, the user specified \"synonyms\" and mentioned maximum two, so maybe they want the most appropriate. \"Stupefied\" and \"entranced\" are both strong synonyms. Let me confirm. Yes, those are correct. So the answer should be \"stupified; entranced\".\n...done thinking.\n\nstupified; entranced"
