  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"commodity\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"commodity\" as a noun. Let me think. Commodity is a general term for a raw material or a product that's interchangeable. Synonyms could be things like \"goods\" or \"raw materials.\" Wait, but \"goods\" is more general. \"Raw material\" is more specific. Hmm, maybe \"goods\" is better here. Let me check if \"goods\" is considered a synonym. Yes, in commerce, goods refer to commodities. So \"goods\" would be a good synonym. Another one might be \"item,\" but that's too vague. \"Material\" is also a synonym, but it's more specific. So between \"goods\" and \"material,\" which is more accurate? \"Material\" is more about the substance, while \"goods\" is about the product. Since commodity can be both, maybe \"goods\" is better. Let me confirm. In dictionary terms, \"goods\" is often used as a synonym. So the answer should be \"goods;\" \"material.\" But wait, the user asked for maximum two synonyms. So I can list them as \"goods; material.\" But I need to make sure they are correct. Another possible synonym is \"item,\" but that's too generic. So yes, \"goods\" and \"material\" are appropriate.\n...done thinking.\n\ngoods; material"
