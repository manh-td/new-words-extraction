  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"secularized\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for the antonyms of \"secularized\" (verb). Let me think. First, I need to recall what \"secularized\" means. It's an adjective that describes something that has been influenced by secular factors, meaning less religious or more influenced by non-religious ideas. As a verb, \"secularize\" means to make something secular, to remove religious elements.\n\nSo the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of being secularized. That would be things that are religious or still have religious elements. Common antonyms might be \"religious\" or \"theological.\" But wait, the user wants antonyms for the verb \"secularized,\" so maybe the nouns? Wait, no, the question says antonyms, but the word given is a verb. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user specified \"antonyms (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ). Respond with plain text only.\" So even though \"secularized\" is a verb, the antonyms would be nouns? Or maybe the adjectives? Wait, the verb \"secularize\" can take adjectives, but the antonyms would be the opposite of the meaning. So the opposite of \"secularized\" (as in made secular) would be \"religious\" or \"theological.\" But maybe \"religious\" is more direct. Alternatively, \"theological\" is a bit more specific. But maybe \"religious\" is the main antonym here.\n\nWait, but the user might be looking for the antonyms of the adjective form. Since the word given is a verb, maybe the antonyms are the adjectives. So \"religious\" and \"theological\" could be the antonyms. But I need to check if those are correct. Alternatively, \"spiritual\" might also be an antonym, but that's more about being devoted to a belief system. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, \"theological\" is more about religious study, while \"religious\" is about the practice. So maybe \"religious\" is the primary antonym. But I should confirm. Let me think of examples. If something is secularized, it's not religious. So the antonyms would be things that are religious. So \"religious\" and \"theological\" could be the antonyms. But maybe \"theological\" is more specific. However, the user might accept both. So the answer would be \"religious; theological\" or \"religious; theological\". But since the user wants maximum 2, and if there are multiple, join them. So the answer would be \"religious; theological\".\n...done thinking.\n\nreligious; theological"
