  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"secularized\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"secularized\" as a verb. Let me start by understanding what \"secularized\" means. It refers to the process of making something secular, meaning removing religious influence or making it less religious. So, the antonyms would be words that contrast with this idea.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean the opposite of being secularized. The primary antonyms might be \"religious\" or \"spiritual,\" but since the question is about the verb form, maybe \"religious\" is more direct. Another possible antonym is \"theological,\" but that's more about religious study. Wait, \"secularized\" is about removing religion, so the opposite would be something that preserves religion. So \"religious\" is a strong candidate. \n\nAnother possible antonym is \"theological,\" but I'm not sure if that's the most direct. Let me check. \"Secularized\" means making something secular, so the opposite would be \"religious\" or \"theological.\" However, \"theological\" is more about the study of religion, while \"religious\" is more about the state of being religious. \n\nSo, the two most direct antonyms are \"religious\" and \"theological.\" But I need to make sure. Let me think again. If you secularize something, you make it not religious. So the antonyms would be words that are religious. So \"religious\" is the main one. The other one might be \"theological,\" but maybe that's not as direct. \n\nWait, the user asked for antonyms, so both \"religious\" and \"theological\" could be considered. But maybe \"theological\" is more about the study of religion, while \"religious\" is about the state. So perhaps \"religious\" is the better answer. However, the user might expect both. Let me check if there's a standard antonym for \"secularized.\" \n\nIn some contexts, \"theological\" could be an antonym, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, \"religious\" is more straightforward. So I'll go with \"religious\" and \"theological\" as the two antonyms. But I need to make sure they are correct. \n\nAnother possibility is \"spiritual,\" but that's more about the state of being spiritual, which is a bit different. So maybe \"religious\" is the best answer. But the user asked for two antonyms. So I'll list both \"religious\" and \"theological\" as the antonyms.\n...done thinking.\n\nreligious; theological"
