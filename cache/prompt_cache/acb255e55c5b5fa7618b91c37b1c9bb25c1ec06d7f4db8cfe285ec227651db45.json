  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"palatable\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"palatable\" (an adjective). Let me think. Palatable means pleasant to the taste, so synonyms could be something like \"tasty\" or \"satisfying.\" Wait, but \"tasty\" is more about being enjoyable in taste, which is close. Then there's \"agreeable\" because it means pleasant to the senses. But \"agreeable\" is more about being pleasant in general, not specifically taste. So maybe \"tasty\" is better. Let me check if \"palatable\" and \"tasty\" are considered synonyms here. Yes, they are often used interchangeably. Another possible synonym is \"pleasant,\" but that's more general. So the best ones are \"tasty\" and \"satisfying.\" Wait, \"satisfying\" is more about fulfilling the taste, but maybe \"tasty\" is more direct. Let me confirm. In dictionaries, \"palatable\" is often listed with \"tasty\" as a synonym. So the answer should be \"tasty; satisfying.\" But the user wants maximum two, so that's two. Alternatively, \"tasty\" and \"agreeable\" could work, but \"agreeable\" is more about being pleasant in general. So I think \"tasty; satisfying\" is better. Let me make sure there are no other common synonyms. Maybe \"pleasant\" but that's more general. So the final answer is \"tasty; satisfying.\"\n...done thinking.\n\ntasty; satisfying"
