  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"geodesic\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to provide two example sentences using the word \"geodesic\" as an adjective. Let me think about how to use it correctly.\n\nFirst, \"geodesic\" relates to something that follows the shortest path on a curved surface, like a sphere. So maybe an example in geometry or navigation. \n\nSentence 1: Maybe something like \"The geodesic on the Earth's surface connects two points directly.\" That's straightforward. \n\nSentence 2: Perhaps a more practical example, like \"The airplane follows a geodesic route to minimize travel distance.\" That shows application in real-world scenarios. \n\nI need to make sure the sentences are correct and use the word properly. Check if \"geodesic\" is used as an adjective here. Yes, both sentences use it correctly. No need for JSON or explanation, just the two sentences in the required format.\n...done thinking.\n\ntraveling across the globe, the geodesic route ensures the shortest path; the geodesic dome is a structure that accurately reflects the curvature of the Earth."
