  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"geodesic\"(adjective).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the word \"geodesic\" as an adjective. Let me think about how to use it correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the meaning of \"geodesic.\" It refers to something that follows the shortest path between two points, like a line on a sphere. So, maybe something related to mathematics or navigation.\n\nMaybe an example in mathematics: \"The geodesic on a sphere is the shortest path between two points.\" That's straightforward. Then another example in a real-world context, like architecture. \"The building's design incorporates geodesic principles to distribute weight efficiently.\"\n\nWait, I should check if \"geodesic\" is commonly used in architecture. Yes, it's used in structures like geodesic domes. So that sentence makes sense. Let me make sure the sentences are correct and not too complex. The user wants maximum two sentences, so that's fine. Alright, I think that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nthe geodesic line on the map shows the shortest path between two points; the geodesic dome is a structure that efficiently distributes weight using mathematical principles."
