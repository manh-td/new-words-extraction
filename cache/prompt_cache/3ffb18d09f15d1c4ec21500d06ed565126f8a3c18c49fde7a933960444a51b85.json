  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"snub\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for antonyms of the word \"snub\" as a verb. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"snub\" means. From what I remember, \"snub\" as a verb means to insult or make fun of someone, usually in a way that's mean or disrespectful. So, the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of insulting or making fun.\n\nNow, thinking about antonyms for \"snub.\" The most obvious ones come to mind. \"Praise\" comes to mind because if you praise someone, you're not snubbing them. Then there's \"respect,\" since showing respect is the opposite of insulting. Wait, but is \"respect\" considered an antonym here? Maybe. Alternatively, \"admire\" could work, but \"praise\" is more direct. Let me double-check.\n\nAnother possible antonym is \"honour,\" but that might be more formal. \"Praise\" is more common in everyday usage. So, the two antonyms would be \"praise\" and \"respect.\" But I need to make sure these are correct. Let me think again. \"Snub\" can also mean to slight someone, so \"respect\" is the opposite. \"Praise\" is the direct opposite. So yes, those are the antonyms. I should list them as \"praise; respect.\"\n...done thinking.\n\npraise; respect"
