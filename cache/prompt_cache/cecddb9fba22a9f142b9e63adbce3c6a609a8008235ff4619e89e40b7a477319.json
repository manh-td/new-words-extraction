  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"anthropologist\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences using the word \"anthropologist\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. An anthropologist studies humans, right? So the sentences should show someone studying humans.\n\nMaybe start with a sentence about a researcher. Like, \"An anthropologist studies human behavior in different cultures.\" That's straightforward. Then another one could be about a specific study. \"The anthropologist conducted a survey to understand cultural traditions.\" Wait, does \"conducted a survey\" fit? Maybe \"carried out a survey\" sounds better. Or \"analyzed cultural practices.\" Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use \"anthropologist\" in a different context. Like, \"The museum curator is an anthropologist who specializes in ancient artifacts.\" That works. But the user asked for maximum two sentences. Let me check the examples again. The first one I thought of is good, and the second one could be another example. I need to make sure both sentences are correct and use the word properly. Also, avoid any markdown, just plain text. Alright, I think that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nanthropologist studies human behavior in different cultures; the anthropologist analyzed cultural practices to understand societal norms."
