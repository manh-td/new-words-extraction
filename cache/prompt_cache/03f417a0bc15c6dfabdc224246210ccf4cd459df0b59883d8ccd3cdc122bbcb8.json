  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"geodesic\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for synonyms of \"geodesic\" (an adjective). First, I need to recall what geodesic means. From what I remember, a geodesic is a path that measures the shortest distance between two points on a surface, like a sphere. So, it's related to geometry, specifically the shortest path.\n\nNow, thinking of synonyms. The word \"geodesic\" is quite specific, so the synonyms should be related to the concept of the shortest path. Words like \"optimal\" come to mind because they refer to the best possible path. Another possible synonym might be \"minimal,\" since minimal paths are the shortest ones. But I need to check if those are accurate.\n\nWait, \"optimal\" is more about being the best in some sense, not necessarily the shortest. But in the context of geodesics, it might be used. \"Minimal\" is more directly related to the shortest path. So maybe \"minimal\" is a better synonym. Let me confirm. \n\nAnother thought: \"geodesic\" can also be associated with \"geodesic\" in the context of geometry, so terms like \"shortest path\" or \"optimal path\" could be synonyms. But the user wants synonyms as a single string separated by semicolons. So maybe \"optimal; minimal\" or \"shortest; optimal\". \n\nI need to make sure these are correct. Let me think again. In mathematics, a geodesic is indeed a shortest path, so \"minimal\" is accurate. \"Optimal\" might be used in some contexts, but \"minimal\" is more direct. So the best synonyms would be \"minimal\" and \"optimal\". But I should check if \"optimal\" is commonly used in this context. \n\nAlternatively, \"shortest\" could be a synonym, but that's more of a definition. The user might be looking for terms that describe the property of being a geodesic, not just the path itself. So \"minimal\" is better. \n\nSo the answer should be \"minimal; optimal\". But I need to make sure there are only two. Let me check if there are others. \"Shortest\" is a synonym but maybe not as precise. The user might prefer more specific terms. So I'll go with \"minimal; optimal\".\n...done thinking.\n\nminimal; optimal"
