  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"geodesic\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"geodesic\" (an adjective). Let me think. Geodesic means relating to the shortest path between two points on a surface, like in geometry. Synonyms could be something like \"shortest\" or \"optimal\". Wait, \"optimal\" might be more about being the best possible. Another possibility is \"minimal\", but that's more about the smallest possible. Hmm, \"shortest\" is a direct synonym. \"Optimal\" might be closer to \"best\" but not exactly the same. Let me check if \"shortest\" is commonly used with geodesic. Yeah, in mathematics, geodesic is often referred to as the shortest path. So \"shortest\" is a good synonym. \"Optimal\" might be a bit different. But the user wants synonyms, so maybe both? But the maximum is two. So I should list them as shortest; optimal. Wait, but sometimes \"optimal\" is used in different contexts. However, in the context of geodesic, \"shortest\" is more accurate. So the answer would be shortest; optimal. But I need to make sure there's no better synonym. Another option is \"minimal\", but that's more about the minimum value. So I think the correct synonyms are shortest and optimal.\n...done thinking.\n\nshortest; optimal"
