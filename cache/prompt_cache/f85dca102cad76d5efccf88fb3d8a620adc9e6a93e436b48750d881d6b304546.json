  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"guise\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to provide two example sentences using the word \"guise\" as a noun. Let me think. \"Guise\" means the way someone appears, especially to others. So, possible sentences could be something like \"She wore a disguise to attend the party\" or \"The actor changed his guise to play the villain.\" Wait, but the user specified \"noun\" usage. Let me check if \"guise\" is indeed a noun here. Yes, it's a noun meaning a pretended appearance. So, the sentences should use it as a noun. Maybe \"The detective had to change his guise to avoid suspicion\" and \"The magician used a special guise to trick the audience.\" Hmm, but \"guise\" as a noun is more commonly used in contexts like \"mask\" or \"appearance.\" Maybe \"The actor's guise was perfect\" and \"The politician's guise was carefully crafted.\" Yeah, that makes sense. Let me make sure the sentences are correct and fit the noun usage.\n...done thinking.\n\nShe wore a disguise to attend the party; The actor's guise was perfect."
