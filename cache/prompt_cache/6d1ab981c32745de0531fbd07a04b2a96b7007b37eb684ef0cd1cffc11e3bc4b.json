  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"transfixed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"transfixed\" (verb). First, I need to recall what the antonyms are. \"Transfixed\" means to be so completely absorbed that one is unable to move or think. So antonyms would be words that mean the opposite, like not being absorbed or focused.\n\nThinking about synonyms first might help. The synonyms are \"bewildered,\" \"dazzled,\" \"stunned,\" \"amazed,\" \"captivated,\" \"enamored,\" \"entranced,\" \"fixed,\" \"immersed,\" \"lost,\" \"overwhelmed,\" \"surrendered,\" \"trapped,\" \"unmoved,\" \"unaffected,\" \"unstoppable,\" \"unstoppable,\" \"unstoppable.\" But the user asked for antonyms, not synonyms.\n\nSo antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of being transfixed. Words like \"unmoved,\" \"unaffected,\" \"unstoppable,\" \"disinterested,\" \"unaffected,\" \"unstoppable,\" \"unstoppable.\" Wait, \"unstoppable\" is more about being unable to stop, but maybe \"disinterested\" is a good one. Let me check.\n\n\"Unmoved\" means not moved by something, which is opposite of being transfixed. \"Unaffected\" means not affected, which could work. \"Disinterested\" is about not being biased, but maybe not exactly the opposite. \"Unstoppable\" is more about being unable to stop, but maybe not the direct antonym. \n\nSo the main antonyms are \"unmoved\" and \"unaffected.\" Let me confirm. \"Transfixed\" is about being so absorbed that you can't move. So \"unmoved\" would be the opposite. \"Unaffected\" means not affected, which could be the opposite. \"Disinterested\" is about not being biased, but maybe that's a different sense. \n\nSo the two strongest antonyms are \"unmoved\" and \"unaffected.\" I should list them and join them with semicolons. Check if there are any others. Maybe \"unstoppable\" is a bit off, but the user might accept \"unaffected\" and \"unmoved\" as the main ones. So the answer should be \"unmoved; unaffected.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nunmoved; unaffected"
