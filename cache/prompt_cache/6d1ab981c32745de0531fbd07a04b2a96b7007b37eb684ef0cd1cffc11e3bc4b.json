  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"transfixed\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"transfixed\" (verb). Let me start by recalling what \"transfixed\" means. It means to be so completely amazed or impressed that one is unable to move or think. So, the antonyms would be words that mean the opposite of being amazed or impressed.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean the opposite of being fixed or amazed. Words like \"dazzled\" come to mind, but that's more about being blinded by something. Then there's \"amazed\" itself, but the user wants antonyms, not synonyms. So maybe \"dazzled\" is a good one. Another possibility is \"bewildered,\" which means confused or bewildered, but that's more about confusion rather than being amazed. \n\nWait, \"dazzled\" could be an antonym because it's about being blinded by something, which might relate to the sense of being amazed. Then \"bewildered\" is another option. But I need to check if these are accurate. \n\nAnother antonym might be \"numb\" or \"insensate,\" but those are more about not feeling rather than being amazed. So maybe \"dazzled\" and \"bewildered\" are the best choices. Let me confirm. \"Dazzled\" means to make someone blind with light, which can be a synonym for being amazed. \"Bewildered\" is more about confusion. So maybe \"dazzled\" is the main antonym, and \"bewildered\" is another. But I need to make sure they are indeed antonyms. \n\nAlternatively, \"unimpressed\" is an antonym, but that's more about not being impressed. So maybe \"dazzled\" and \"unimpressed\" are better. Wait, the user wants antonyms for \"transfixed,\" which is about being amazed. So \"unimpressed\" would be a good antonym. But I need to check if that's the standard antonym. \n\nHmm, maybe \"dazzled\" and \"unimpressed\" are the best antonyms. But I should stick to the most accurate ones. Let me think again. The word \"transfixed\" is often used in contexts like being overwhelmed by something. So antonyms would be things that don't cause that state. \"Dazzled\" is about being blinded by light, which can be a cause of being amazed. \"Bewildered\" is about confusion, which is different. \"Unimpressed\" is about not being impressed. So maybe \"dazzled\" and \"unimpressed\" are the best antonyms. But the user asked for maximum two, so I can list them as \"dazzled; unimpressed\". \n\nAlternatively, \"bewildered\" might be another option. But I think \"dazzled\" is more directly opposite. So the answer should be \"dazzled; unimpressed\".\n...done thinking.\n\ndazzled; unimpressed"
