  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"geodesic\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants me to come up with two example sentences using the word \"geodesic\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to recall what a geodesic is. It's a path that measures the shortest distance between two points on a curved surface, like the Earth. So, maybe sentences related to navigation or geometry.\n\nSentence 1: Maybe something about measuring distances on a globe. Like, \"The geodesic distance between two cities is calculated using the Earth's curvature.\" That makes sense. \n\nSentence 2: Perhaps an example in mathematics. \"In differential geometry, a geodesic is a curve that represents the shortest path between two points on a manifold.\" That's accurate. \n\nWait, the user specified \"noun\" so the sentences should use it as a noun. Let me check the examples. The first sentence uses \"geodesic\" as a noun. The second one also uses it as a noun. \n\nI need to make sure the sentences are correct. The first one is about navigation, the second about mathematics. Both are valid. Should I use \"path\" in the second sentence? Maybe. \"A geodesic is a path that minimizes distance on a curved surface.\" That's better. \n\nSo the final answer would be the two sentences. Let me format them as specified: sentence 1; sentence 2. No JSON, no explanation. Got it.\n...done thinking.\n\npath; a geodesic is the shortest path between two points on a curved surface; in mathematics, a geodesic is a curve that minimizes distance on a manifold."
