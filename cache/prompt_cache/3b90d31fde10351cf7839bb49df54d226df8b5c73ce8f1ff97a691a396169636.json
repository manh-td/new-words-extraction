  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"geodesic\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences using the word \"geodesic\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the correct context. A geodesic is a path that measures the shortest distance between two points on a curved surface, like the Earth. So, it's a mathematical concept.\n\nI should come up with two sentences that show different applications. Maybe one where it's a path on a globe, and another where it's a concept in geometry. Let me check if those are accurate. Yes, a geodesic on a sphere is a great circle, and in differential geometry, it's a curve with zero curvature. \n\nWait, the user asked for noun usage, so the sentences should be nouns. So, \"a geodesic on a spherical map\" and \"a geodesic in differential geometry\". That makes sense. Let me make sure the sentences are correct and not too complicated. Yeah, that should work.\n...done thinking.\n\na geodesic on a spherical map; a geodesic in differential geometry"
