  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bohemian\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user asked for synonyms of \"bohemian\" (noun). Let me think. A bohemian is someone who lives a bohemian lifestyle, which means they're unconventional, maybe artistic, and don't follow traditional social norms. So synonyms would be words that mean someone who is free-spirited or artistic.\n\nFirst, \"free-spirited\" comes to mind. It describes someone who is not bound by conventional ideas. Then there's \"artistic\" because bohemians are often creative and involved in the arts. Are there any others? Maybe \"wild-hearted\" but that's more about emotional nature. \"Reclusive\" might be a synonym, but that's more about being isolated. Wait, the user specified noun, so \"artistic\" is a good fit. \"Free-spirited\" is also a common synonym. Let me check if those are accurate. Yes, both \"free-spirited\" and \"artistic\" are commonly used to describe bohemians. So the answer should be those two, joined by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\nfree-spirited; artistic"
