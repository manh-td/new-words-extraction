  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bohemian\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of \"bohemian\" as a noun. Let me think. A bohemian is someone who lives a bohemian lifestyle, which means they're unconventional, artistic, maybe wandering, and not conforming to societal norms. So synonyms would be words that mean the same thing but different in form.\n\nFirst, I recall that \"artistic\" is a common synonym. It fits because bohemians are often artists or creative people. Then there's \"free-spirited,\" which describes someone who is not bound by conventional rules or expectations. That also fits the characteristics of a bohemian. \n\nWait, are there any other synonyms? Maybe \"wild-hearted\"? But that might be more about passion rather than the lifestyle. \"Cultural\" could work, but that's more about the culture rather than the lifestyle. \n\nSo the best ones are \"artistic\" and \"free-spirited.\" Let me check if those are commonly accepted. Yes, they are. So the answer should be those two joined by semicolons. I need to make sure not to include any other words and keep it simple.\n...done thinking.\n\nartistic; free-spirited"
