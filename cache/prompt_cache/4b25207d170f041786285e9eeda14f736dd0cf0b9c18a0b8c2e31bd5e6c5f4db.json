  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"uncanny\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"uncanny.\" Let me think. First, I need to recall what \"uncanny\" means. It's an adjective that describes something strange, eerie, or supernatural, often to the point of being unsettling or eerie. So antonyms would be words that contrast with that meaning.\n\nHmm, common antonyms for \"uncanny\" might be words like \"ordinary,\" \"normal,\" or \"familiar.\" But wait, \"ordinary\" is more about being typical, while \"normal\" is about following expected norms. \"Familiar\" is more about being known or common. But which ones are considered antonyms here?\n\nI think \"ordinary\" and \"normal\" are often used as antonyms. \"Familiar\" might not be the best fit because it's more about being known rather than being strange. So maybe \"ordinary\" and \"normal\" are the best antonyms. Let me check if there's a more precise term. Oh, \"familiar\" can sometimes be used as an antonym, but maybe the user wants the most direct antonyms. \n\nSo the answer should be \"ordinary; normal\" or \"ordinary; familiar.\" Wait, but \"familiar\" might not be the strongest antonym. Let me confirm. In dictionary terms, \"uncanny\" is often paired with \"ordinary\" and \"normal\" as antonyms. So the correct antonyms are \"ordinary\" and \"normal.\" Therefore, the answer is \"ordinary; normal.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nordinary; normal"
