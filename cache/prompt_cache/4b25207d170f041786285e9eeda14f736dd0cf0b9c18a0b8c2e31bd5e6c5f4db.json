  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"uncanny\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"uncanny.\" Let me think. First, I need to recall what \"uncanny\" means. It describes something that is strange, eerie, or unsettling, but not necessarily in a bad way. So antonyms would be words that contrast with that sense.\n\nThe most obvious antonyms come to mind: \"normal\" or \"ordinary.\" Because \"uncanny\" refers to something strange, the opposite would be something familiar. Then there's \"common\" or \"usual.\" But I need to make sure these are correct.\n\nWait, \"normal\" is an adjective, so \"normal\" would be the antonym. \"Common\" is also an adjective, so that's another one. But sometimes \"common\" can mean frequent, which might not exactly fit. However, in the context of something being strange, \"common\" could work. \n\nAlternatively, \"ordinary\" is another possible antonym. But the user might prefer the most direct antonyms. Let me check standard dictionaries. \"Uncanny\" antonyms include \"ordinary,\" \"normal,\" \"common,\" and \"familiar.\" But the user wants maximum 2. So between those, \"ordinary\" and \"normal\" are the best choices. \n\nSo the answer should be \"ordinary; normal.\" But I need to make sure there are no other common antonyms. Maybe \"familiar\" is another one, but that's more about being known rather than strange. So sticking with \"ordinary\" and \"normal\" is better. \n\nYes, those are the primary antonyms. So the final answer is \"ordinary; normal.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nordinary; normal"
