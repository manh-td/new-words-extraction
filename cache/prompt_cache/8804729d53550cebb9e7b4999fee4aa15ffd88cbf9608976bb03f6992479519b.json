  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"grain\"(noun).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for synonyms of the word \"grain\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to recall what synonyms are. Synonyms are words that mean the same thing. So, \"grain\" as a noun can refer to the seeds of plants, like wheat or rice. Other synonyms might be \"grain\" itself, but that's the same word. Wait, maybe \"grain\" can also refer to the product, like flour or cereal. So, \"flour\" is a synonym. Another possibility is \"seeds,\" but that's more specific. Let me check. In some contexts, \"grain\" can mean the whole seed, so \"seeds\" might be a synonym. But I need to make sure. The user wants maximum two synonyms. So, \"flour\" and \"seeds\" could be the ones. But I should verify if \"seeds\" is considered a synonym here. Alternatively, \"grain\" can also be \"cereal,\" but that's more of a broader category. Hmm. Let me confirm. In dictionary terms, \"grain\" as a noun can be \"seeds\" or \"flour.\" So, the two synonyms would be \"seeds\" and \"flour.\" But I need to check if \"flour\" is indeed a synonym. Yes, because grain can refer to the processed form. So, the answer should be \"seeds; flour.\" But wait, the user said maximum two, so that's acceptable. I think that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nseeds; flour"
