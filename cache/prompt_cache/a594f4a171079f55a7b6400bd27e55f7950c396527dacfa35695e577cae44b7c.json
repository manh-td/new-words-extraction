  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bohemian\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"bohemian\" (an adjective). First, I need to recall what a bohemian is. They're people who live a bohemian life, often associated with artistic, unconventional lifestyles. So antonyms would be things that are more conventional or traditional.\n\nWhat comes to mind? \"Conventional\" is a good one. It means following accepted norms. Then there's \"traditional,\" which also describes adherence to old ways. Both are antonyms. Let me check if there are others. \"Modern\" could work, but \"modern\" is more about current trends, while \"conventional\" is about adherence. \"Traditional\" is more about age-old practices. So between the two, \"conventional\" and \"traditional\" are the best antonyms. I should present them as a string separated by semicolons.\n...done thinking.\n\nconventional; traditional"
