  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"bohemian\"(adjective).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"bohemian\" (an adjective). Let me start by recalling what a bohemian is. From what I know, a bohemian is someone who lives a free-spirited, artistic life, often without conventional constraints. So, antonyms would be words that contrast with this.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean the opposite of \"bohemian.\" The most obvious antonym might be \"conventional\" or \"traditional,\" but I should check if those fit. Wait, the user specified \"antonyms\" and wants them in a string separated by semicolons. Let me think again.\n\nAnother possible antonym is \"civilized,\" but that might be too broad. \"Urban\" or \"city\" could be related, but they're more about location than the lifestyle. Maybe \"conformist\" or \"traditionalist\"? Hmm.\n\nWait, \"bohemian\" is often associated with rejecting societal norms, so antonyms might include \"conventional,\" \"traditional,\" or \"civilized.\" But I need to make sure these are accurate. Let me verify. \n\nYes, \"conventional\" and \"traditional\" are direct antonyms. \"Civilized\" might be a bit more vague, but it can work. However, the user wants maximum two antonyms. So, perhaps \"conventional\" and \"traditional\" are the best choices. \n\nI should check if there's a more precise term. \"Urban\" isn't exactly an antonym. \"Modern\" might be closer, but it's not as direct. So sticking with \"conventional\" and \"traditional\" seems correct. Let me make sure there are only two. Yes, that's two. So the answer would be \"conventional; traditional\".\n...done thinking.\n\nconventional; traditional"
