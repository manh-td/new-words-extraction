  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"primate\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for antonyms of the word \"primate\" as a noun. Let me start by recalling what \"primate\" means. From what I know, a primate is an animal that's part of the primate order, which includes apes, monkeys, and similar creatures. So, the antonyms would be animals that aren't in this group.\n\nThe primary antonyms would be animals from different orders. For example, birds and mammals. But wait, the question specifies \"primate\" as a noun, so the antonyms should be animals that are not primates. So, birds and mammals are obvious ones. But maybe there are others? Like reptiles or fish? But the user wants the maximum of two, so probably birds and mammals. Let me check if there are any other common antonyms. Maybe \"rodent\" but that's a different order. But the main ones are birds and mammals. So the answer should be birds; mammals.\n...done thinking.\n\nbirds;mammals"
