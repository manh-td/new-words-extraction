  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"primate\"(noun).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the word \"primate\" as a noun and asked for its antonyms. First, I need to recall what the antonyms of \"primate\" are. \n\nHmm, \"primate\" refers to a member of the primate order, which includes apes, monkeys, and similar creatures. So the antonyms would be things that are not primates. The most obvious ones are something like \"non-primate\" but since the user wants specific words, maybe \"non-primate\" isn't a standard noun. Wait, maybe \"non-primate\" is too general. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: the antonyms of \"primate\" in the context of classification. The opposite of a primate would be something that isn't part of that group. So \"non-primate\" is the general term, but the user might be looking for specific words. However, in standard dictionaries, the antonyms might be \"non-primate\" or \"non-ape\" but those are more specific. \n\nWait, maybe \"non-primate\" is considered an antonym here. But the user wants the answer in plain text, maximum two antonyms. So if \"non-primate\" is acceptable, that's one. But maybe there's another word. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, \"non-primate\" is the general term, but maybe \"non-ape\" is another. But \"non-ape\" is more specific. However, the user might expect \"non-primate\" as the main antonym. Since the question allows for maximum two, and if \"non-primate\" is one, then the other could be \"non-ape\" or \"non-mammal\" but those are more specific. \n\nWait, but the original word is \"primate\" as a noun, so the antonyms would be things that are not primates. So \"non-primate\" is the general term. But maybe the user expects specific words. However, in standard English, the antonym of \"primate\" (as in a member of the primate order) is \"non-primate,\" but that's a general term. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"non-ape\" is another antonym, but that's more specific. But since the user is asking for antonyms, and \"non-primate\" is the general term, maybe that's the answer. But the user might expect two specific words. However, if there are multiple, they need to be joined by semicolons. \n\nWait, maybe \"non-primate\" is the only antonym. But the user said maximum two. So maybe \"non-primate\" and \"non-ape\" as two antonyms. But I need to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, \"non-primate\" is the primary antonym, and \"non-ape\" is another. But I'm not sure if \"non-ape\" is considered an antonym here. Maybe the user expects \"non-primate\" as the only antonym. \n\nBut since the user allows for two, and if \"non-primate\" is one, then maybe the other is \"non-ape\". However, I need to check if those are standard antonyms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the antonyms are \"non-primate\" and \"non-mammal\", but that's more specific. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the safest answer is \"non-primate\" as the only antonym, but since the user asked for maximum two, maybe \"non-primate\" and \"non-ape\" are the two. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, the original word is \"primate\" as a noun, so the antonyms would be things that are not primates. So \"non-primate\" is the general term. But maybe \"non-ape\" is another. However, \"non-ape\" is more specific. \n\nIn conclusion, the antonyms are \"non-primate\" and \"non-ape\", but since the user might expect \"non-primate\" as the main answer, but the instruction says maximum two. So I'll list them as \"non-primate; non-ape\".\n...done thinking.\n\nnon-primate; non-ape"
