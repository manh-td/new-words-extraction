  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"guise\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for synonyms of the verb \"guise\" and wants them joined by semicolons if there are multiple. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"guise\" means. From what I recall, \"guise\" can mean to present oneself in a certain way, especially to deceive or disguise one's true nature. So, synonyms would be words that mean to disguise or pretend.\n\nThinking of synonyms, \"mask\" comes to mind because both mean to cover up or pretend. Another one might be \"pretend,\" but I'm not sure if that's a direct synonym. Wait, \"pretend\" is more about acting in a certain way, while \"mask\" is more about covering up. Maybe \"mask\" is a better synonym. Then there's \"disguise\" itself, but the user asked for synonyms, and \"disguise\" is the actual word. So maybe \"mask\" is the main synonym. Are there any others? \"Act\" could work, but that's more about performing rather than disguising. \"Cover\" is another possibility, but \"mask\" is more specific. So the best synonyms would be \"mask\" and \"pretend.\" But I need to check if \"pretend\" is considered a synonym here. Alternatively, \"mask\" and \"deceive\" might be options, but \"deceive\" is more about tricking someone. Hmm. The most accurate synonyms here are \"mask\" and \"pretend.\" So the answer should be \"mask; pretend.\"\n...done thinking.\n\nmask; pretend"
