  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"guise\"(verb).\nAnswer only **synonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking for synonyms of the verb \"guise\" and wants them joined by semicolons if there are multiple. First, I need to make sure I understand what \"guise\" means. From what I remember, \"guise\" can mean to present oneself in a particular way, or to act in a role. So synonyms would be words that mean to disguise or act in a different manner.\n\nThinking about synonyms for \"guise,\" words like \"mask\" come to mind because masking one's true self is a common meaning. Then there's \"act\" as in to perform a role, but \"act\" is more about performing rather than disguising. Another possible synonym is \"pretend,\" which directly means to act in a different way. Wait, but \"pretend\" is more about pretending to be someone else, which is similar. \n\nSo the main synonyms here would be \"mask\" and \"pretend.\" Let me check if there are any others. \"Disguise\" itself is the same as \"guise,\" but the user asked for synonyms, so that's not allowed. \"Act\" is a bit different. Maybe \"simulate\" is another option, but that's more about imitating rather than disguising. \n\nSo the best synonyms are \"mask\" and \"pretend.\" I should make sure they are correct. Let me confirm: \"mask\" is a synonym for \"guise\" in the sense of hiding one's true self. \"Pretend\" means to act in a different way, which fits. So those two should be the correct answers. The user wants them joined by semicolons, so the final answer would be \"mask; pretend\".\n...done thinking.\n\nmask; pretend"
