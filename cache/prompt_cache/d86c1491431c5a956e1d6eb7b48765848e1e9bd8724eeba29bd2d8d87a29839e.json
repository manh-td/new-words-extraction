  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"embroiled\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user is asking for the antonyms of the word \"embroiled\" (verb). Let me start by recalling what \"embroiled\" means. It means to be deeply involved or entangled in a situation. So, antonyms would be words that mean the opposite—something not involved or out of the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to think of words that mean being uninvolved or not involved. Words like \"disengaged\" come to mind. That's because if someone is disengaged, they are not involved in the situation. Another possible antonym could be \"separated,\" but that might not fit as perfectly. \"Separated\" implies being physically or emotionally distant, which is a bit different from being involved. \n\nWait, \"disengaged\" is more directly opposite. \"Uninvolved\" is another possible antonym, but the user might expect a word that's a verb. \"Disengaged\" is the adjective form, but the original word is a verb. So maybe \"disengaged\" is the best fit. \n\nAre there any other words? \"Loose\" might not fit. \"Unfettered\" is more about being free, not necessarily involved. \"Out of the loop\" is an idiom, not a direct antonym. \n\nSo the main antonym here is \"disengaged\". The user asked for maximum two, so I can list that. Let me check if there's another common antonym. \"Uninvolved\" as a noun, but the user wants antonyms as verbs. So \"disengaged\" is the best choice. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"disengaged\".\n...done thinking.\n\ndisengaged; uninvolved"
