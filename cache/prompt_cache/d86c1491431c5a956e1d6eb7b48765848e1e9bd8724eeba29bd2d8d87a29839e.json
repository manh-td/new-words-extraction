  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"embroiled\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, so the user wants the antonyms of \"embroiled\" (verb). Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Embroiled\" means involved in a situation, especially one that's complicated or difficult. So antonyms would be words that mean not involved, not in a complicated situation.\n\nPossible antonyms could be \"uninvolved\" or \"disconnected\". Wait, \"uninvolved\" directly opposes being involved. \"Disconnected\" might be a bit more about being separated, but \"uninvolved\" is more about not being engaged. Let me check if \"disconnected\" is a valid antonym. Hmm, maybe \"separate\" or \"isolated\" could work too. But the user asked for antonyms, and the maximum is two. So between \"uninvolved\" and \"disconnected\", which is more accurate? \n\nAlternatively, \"free\" or \"unaffected\" might be options, but those are more about being without influence. \"Uninvolved\" is more about not being part of the situation. So I think \"uninvolved\" and \"disconnected\" are the best antonyms here. Let me confirm by checking a dictionary. Yes, \"uninvolved\" is an antonym, and \"disconnected\" can mean not connected, which is similar. So the answer should be \"uninvolved; disconnected\".\n...done thinking.\n\nuninvolved; disconnected"
