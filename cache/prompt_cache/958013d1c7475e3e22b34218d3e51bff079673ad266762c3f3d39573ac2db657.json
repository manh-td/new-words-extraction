  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"culminating\"(verb).\nAnswer only **antonyms** (maximum 2). If there are multiple, join them into a single string separated by semicolons (; ).\nRespond with plain text only (no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants the antonyms of \"culminating\" as a verb. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. \"Culminating\" means bringing something to a conclusion or peak, right? So antonyms would be words that contrast with that meaning.\n\nThinking of synonyms first might help. The synonyms are \"culminative\" (which is an adjective), \"culminate\" (the verb form), and \"peak\". But the question is about antonyms. So antonyms would be words that go against the process of reaching a conclusion or peak.\n\nPossible antonyms could be \"starting\" or \"beginning\". But wait, \"culminating\" is about reaching a conclusion, so the antonym would be something that doesn't reach a conclusion. So \"starting\" might not be the best. Maybe \"beginning\" is closer. Another possibility is \"starting\" because it's the opposite of culminating. But I need to check if there's a more accurate antonym.\n\nAnother thought: \"culminating\" can also mean reaching a peak, so the antonym might be \"starting\" or \"beginning\". But \"starting\" is more about the beginning of a process, while \"beginning\" is more about the initial point. Maybe \"starting\" is better. However, sometimes \"beginning\" is considered an antonym in this context. Let me verify.\n\nLooking up antonyms for \"culminate\" (verb), the standard antonyms are \"start\" and \"begin\". So \"starting\" and \"beginning\" are both antonyms. But the user asked for maximum two, so I can list them as starting; beginning. But I need to make sure they are correct. Yes, \"culminating\" is the process of reaching a conclusion, so the antonyms are the actions that don't lead to a conclusion, like starting or beginning. So the answer should be starting; beginning.\n...done thinking.\n\nstarting; beginning"
