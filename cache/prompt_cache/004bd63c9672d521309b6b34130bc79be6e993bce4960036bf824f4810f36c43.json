  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"wedlock\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences using the word \"wedlock\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. Wedlock is a noun, and it refers to the state of being married. So, the examples should be sentences where \"wedlock\" is the main term.\n\nI should start with the first sentence. Maybe something like \"The couple celebrated their wedlock with a grand ceremony.\" That's straightforward. Now, the second sentence. Perhaps something more specific, like \"The legal documents were finalized to formalize their wedlock.\" That shows the legal aspect. Wait, but the user said \"maximum 2\" sentences. Let me check the example format again. They want two sentences, each in quotes. So, I need to make sure both are correct. Also, check if the word is used as a noun. Yes, \"wedlock\" is indeed a noun. Alright, those two sentences should work.\n...done thinking.\n\nwedlock; the couple celebrated their wedlock with a grand ceremony; wedlock; the legal documents were finalized to formalize their wedlock"
