  "prompt": "You are an English dictionary assistant.\nGiven the following word \"wedlock\"(noun).\nAnswer only short example sentences of how to use the word in English (maximum 2).\nFormat your response exactly like this:\nsentence 1; sentence 2\n(no JSON, no explanation).",
  "response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants example sentences using the word \"wedlock\" as a noun. Let me think. First, I need to make sure I understand the word correctly. Wedlock is a noun, and it refers to the state of being married. So, the examples should show different contexts where marriage is involved.\n\nMaybe start with a simple sentence about a couple getting married. Then another one about a couple celebrating their wedlock. Wait, \"wedlock\" is a noun, so maybe use it in a sentence where the action is taking place. Like \"They celebrated their wedlock with a grand feast.\" Or \"The couple's wedlock was tested by the challenges of life.\"\n\nI need to check if the word is used correctly. Also, make sure the sentences are short and only use the word once each. Let me draft two sentences. First one: \"The couple celebrated their wedlock with a grand feast.\" Second one: \"The couple's wedlock was tested by the challenges of life.\" Yeah, that works. They both use \"wedlock\" as a noun and show different contexts. I think that's it.\n...done thinking.\n\nwedlock; the couple celebrated their wedlock with a grand feast; the couple's wedlock was tested by the challenges of life."
