nervously, I am in need of assistance formulating a comprehensive research proposal that examines the impact of social media usage on academic performance among high school students. The study should be longitudinal and incorporate both qualitative and quantitative methods with appropriate data collection techniques such as surveys and interviews along with statistical analysis like regression models to identify correlations or causations between variables. This complex proposal must take into account the ethical considerations of researching minors, include a detailed literature review section that synthesizes previous findings while highlighting gaps my study will fill, propose an innovative methodology for engaging with participants and ensuring data reliability despite potential technological limitations in their environment. Furthermore, it should also outline the expected challenges during this research period such as attrition rates or consent issues due to parental concerns about social media exposure while offering strategic solutions to mitigate these problems without compromising on study integrity. Include a realistic timeline and budget projection that aligns with academic standards for funding proposals, ensuring the inclusion of justifiable expenses such as incentives for participants or costs related to securing digital consent forms from parents/guardians while keeping within reason given my university's modest grant offerings. Also provide potential avenues for dissemination that will reach educational stakeholders and contribute meaningfully to the academic community, considering open-access journals as well as conferences with active discourse on education technology ethics
