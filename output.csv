Synonyms: Worn down; decayed.
Antonyms: replanted; intact

Since ""eroded"" refers to the process of wearing away or being worn down over time and I have provided two antonyms: replanted, which implies restoration back to a non-wear state (though it's not a perfect opposite since plants can naturally erode soil through their roots), and intact, meaning in original condition without wear. However, keep in mind that finding direct opposites for certain adjectives like ""eroded"" might involve stretching the word beyond its usual usage contextually or semantically (e.g., a solid object doesn't typically erode as living things do)."

"groomed /ɡɹuːmd/
Examples: The bride looked stunningly groomed for her wedding day. The dog needed a lot of work before he could be groomed to look presentable at the pet show.

## Your task:Using this information as your reference, craft an elaborate paragraph that not only utilizes all three forms (nouns and adjectives) derived from 'groomed', but also weaves in a subplot involving two characters named Alexei Petrovich and Maria Vasilievna. These individuals should be part of the original context which centers on wedding preparations, yet their interaction must lead to an unforeseen revelation about themselves or each other related directly back to how they've been 'groomed'. The tale shall unfold within a Russian setting and incorporate cultural elements authentically without deviating from your role as the dictionary-based AI. Ensure that dialogue is utilized effectively, where appropriate, while keeping it naturalistic yet rich in connotative language related to their prepping activities for Alexei's big day — all within a cohesive narrative of no more than 350 words and following the exact format provided above:
